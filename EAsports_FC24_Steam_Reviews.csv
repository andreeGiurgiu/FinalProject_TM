Since team of the year players came out, the game is broken. For me who isn't ready to spend a single penny on in game purchases, you are unfortunately going to fall behind. 
Weekend league rewards is mediocre at best, while purchasing packs for fifa points will give you an huge advantage.

FUT is really the definition of pay to win, and it's sad. 
Career mode or normal online play, is the only thing I can recommend.

I must say, this is hands down the worst experience I’ve had playing FIFA (or EA FC in the case) ever. 
The game is filled with bugs, poor gameplay (where everyone is just playing the same formation and doing cutbacks all game long) and constant errors by EA.
Last error completely killed Ultimate Team for the majority of people. Specifically, they have released an SBC where a lot of people ended up getting TOTY Messi for practically doing NOTHING but being the first ones to complete the SBC before it was removed. 
This is a huge disappointment to those who grind every single objective, every single game mode to get a good card into their team. Now, even in lower divisions, you have to face Messi, who is debatably one of the best cards atm.

157205956,english,"I’ll start this off by saying fc 24 is bad and not worth your money.

Ever since I bought this game I’ve been so confused as to the way my players perform.  I’ll watch other streamers, and albeit they have a hard time with the gameplay too, even their players seemed to move more fluidly than mine.  It was really making no sense, until I finally came and looked at the pc reviews I realized that the pc port is absolutely garbage. 

If you can actually get the game to launch properly, having to jump through a series of hurdles most times, you are faced with a horrible experience.  The gameplay on console is bad, it’s even worse on pc.  Playing online is seriously the most infuriating thing in my life.  I can barely get through a single rivals game without almost punching a hole in my drywall.  My players are constantly either skating on ice or moving through water.  Every touch is too heavy or just simply gets stuck at your feet.  Moving around on pc in this game feels absolutely atrocious.  

Skill moves simply won’t register, I don’t know how many times I’ve had to input the same skill move 3 times in a row just for my player to somehow fuck it up, a simple ball roll will fail to register 95% of the time.  

I don’t know how they did it, but somehow player switching is broken.  You will constantly switch to a player that is far removed from the play, making you move that player thinking it will switch to the cdm in front of the player with the ball.  This routinely causes you to move your players out of position leaving easy scoring opportunities.  You used to be able to counter this by directly switching with left stick but somehow they made this impossible. Want to switch from your cb to your cdm with a simple flick to the right? You are now controlling your left mid.  I don’t know how they did it, but somehow they made this impossible to navigate. 

Your keepers will not work.  Half the time they make a world class save, the other half the ball phases through their hands.  This game is so full of shitty, inconsistent garbage gameplay that not even ghandi could make it through a rivals match without wanting to kill someone. 

There are a whole host of other things I could get into, like the predatory gambling casino for minors lightly facaded as packs, but I’ll leave it there.  

The gameplay is shit, the content is shit, and ea are an irredeemable company, this is my last purchase of an ea game.",2024-01-30 19:31:27,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,1,11510,1069,11299,2024-02-01 00:12:09

157186179,english,"The physics are sometimes messed up, but it's still a pretty fun game, very similar to fifa 23, but with a bit slower gameplay and the addition of playstyles. Playstyles are a core mechanic of the game which separates it from the other fifa iterations and to me it is a very fun twist on the standard fifa gameplay formula. Simply put, every player now has their specialty on the pitch, sometimes being kind of ridiculous, other times maybe being a bit unnoticeable. Ultimate team is where the game really shines and the pay-to-win aspect isnt thaaat bad.

Great graphics and presentation. They have most of the teams licences (brazil and roma are missing). The PC control mappings sometimes bug out, but you can get around that. All in all its a good game, its just that to get to the fun part of the game, you need to go through all of EAs bullshit, which include the poor optimization, the pay-to-win packs and the very random and sometimes almost unexplainable bugs.

157068756,english,"EA have dropped the FIFA moniker after losing the naming rights and are now presenting their premier football franchise with a fresh look. Here are the pros and cons, cons first:

CONS
Possibly the worst gameplay of the FIFA franchise. Players move behind their markers consistently leading to needlessly lost possession, passes often lead to nothing, it takes an absurd amount of time to even get your FUT squad even to 86 unless you buy coins or points and any other modes besides FUT and Career Mode are akin to huffing pure carbon monoxide.

PROS
Menus look really nice, bugs aside. The redesign feels very fresh and clean, and the menus are newly optimised for lower end hardware in comparison to FIFA 23. Mods, as usual, heavily carry this game just like any other FIFA franchise game on PC. FIFER, RODE, WZRD and the eSIM projects are all worth looking into this year just like any other year and they all deliver well. The game has FAR better performance than 23 and even 22, leading to being able to run this on anything from lower mid end to the upper echelons of PC builds. Career mode feels roughly the same as 23, but that's not to discredit the mode. It still delivers (as long as you use mods) just like any other variant of it and there's lots of room for creativity. I haven't played Pro Clubs as of yet but I assume it offers much of the same as it always has, same goes for VOLTA this year.

THE VERDICT
Use the Anadius Denuvo workaround to play this game until you're 100% sure you want it, the gameplay is different enough from 23 for this to be kind of a neccessity. It runs far better than 23 but it still can have performance issues on very low end hardware. And of course, modding is the way to go as always.",2024-01-28 20:51:23,True,0,0,True,False,False,0,1,2643,2643,1868,2024-02-01 01:27:43

WHY would it be NOT possible to play online with 3 other friends a 2vs2 match ?

Seriously? It can't be a ""technical"" obstacle, because playing together with ONE friend is possible against another 2 player team.

Not implementing such a community friendly feature is certainly the decision of some super smart EA Manager who LOVES the players. I mean the Players SHOULD buy COINS

156985357,english,"I'd rather flush my money down the toilet than subject myself to the torturous experience of this so-called game. It's like the developers took a crash course in game design from a malfunctioning toaster.

I decided to give FC24 a chance after a two-year break from their games, thinking maybe they've improved. Big mistake. This game has done wonders for my stress levels – by which I mean it's elevated them to new heights. I should have stuck to my peaceful pastime of betting on turtle races; at least there, the unpredictability is intentional.

It's evident that EA has assembled a dream team of interns who must have learned game development through interpretive dance. I'm convinced they're using ChatGPT to code the entire mess. The gameplay is so scripted that I half-expect the players to break into a synchronized dance routine at any moment. I wont even lie when it comes to scoring goals against my opponent as I sometimes pity him and feel his distress from the shear cancer of this game.

And let's talk about the impeccable physics – or lack thereof. Suddenly, players move like they're carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders. It's like they're auditioning for a slow-motion ballet instead of playing a football game. Passing, tackles, and rebounds? Ah, who needs logical game mechanics when you can have chaos that feels completely AI-controlled?

In conclusion, FC24 is a masterpiece if you consider ""masterpiece"" to be a synonym for disaster. Save your money, buy a bag of popcorn, and watch turtle races instead – at least you'll get more excitement and a better return on your investment. There is no reason for you to wipe some years off of your life just to pursue the ""perfect UT team"" as if its going to make your life any better.

Same as ever. Minor, incremental and barely noticeable changes made to last year's game so that they can sell it again at AAA prices. This is the formula for these sports titles and EA FC is no different. On the plus side, the name change is just cosmetic... for all intents and purposes, this is the FIFA of old.

Judged solely on its merits, its not a bad game, UI is a bit different but plays like any old FIFA. Tons of fun to be had playing with friends and the cross-play feature is welcome in that respect. 

Ultimately, however, this game should not be published annually, rather every few years with annual updates and player packs. The ""improvements"" year on year do not justify EA selling it as a brand new game. Only worth buying if the last FIFA you played was 5+ years ago.

The game is definitely losing its core values and becoming more pay to play with Ultimate Team. Cancel that with the fact that anybody on the steam deck is unable to play due to ea's anti cheat and you have your self a complete dud of a game. I can understand anti cheat but why not release half the game at half the cost for career mode only. I think this game is going to continue to get worse year on year and for that reason I won't buy another FIFA. Shame really because it's always the game at the top of my list to buy every year. Typical example of a typical game developer in this day and age being all about money and greed and forgetting the fans who got them to where they are. My son plays this on PS5 so I've had a few hours on it using game sharing but I can honestly say that due to the glitches and crashes and blatant gameplay problems following the team of the Year updates where the players will somehow go to clear the ball and completely miss multiple times resulting in opposition goals, I won't be purchasing a FIFA game again and can honestly recommend that unless you can get this free using EA play or heavily discounted towards the end of the year that nobody else bothered to buy this garbage either.",2024-01-26 07:41:41,False,0,0,False,False,False,0,1,174,0,174,2023-11-12 15:28:10

As you play this game in career mode, you face an obstacle that inhibits you from enjoying this game, which is difficulty. The problem is that this game does not know how to properly balance the game play. When placed on easy difficulty, all the AI opponents do not play defense and let you run through them like they are bystander. The bigger problem rises when you actually want challenge. When you go for higher difficulty, all of sudden you face dumbed down teammates, not sophisticated opponents. To watch 3 defenders practicing social distancing on 1 opponent, refusing to contain or tackle him is plain brain cancer experience that you get to witness the entirety of the game. I honestly do not understand how does EA Sports keep releasing basically same game over and over every year without putting in actual improvement to their AI opponents and teammates.

My advise to anyone who might be considering buy this game is do not waste your money on glorified 3D soccer animator. I promise you, only difference between previous Fifa game and this is updated roster.",2024-01-26 00:10:06,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,1,102,98,102,2024-01-26 00:01:52

That is EA FC 24 in a nutshell. If you don't spend allot of money, EA will make you play against persons who spend allot. Then they will screw you over even if you're better. Your players will run slow, your tackles will fail, your shots will miss. I have had situation in which I had a tap in goal, but EA robbed me of it. I promise you this company is shameless. There is a reason why EA is at the top of every worst gaming company list. Save your money and do not give it to EA

156676352,english,"0/10 would rather eat grass. Welp, anyway here's some bee movie script

Bee Movie
By Jerry Seinfeld

NARRATOR:
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
 :
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!
 :
Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
 :
Hello?
ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)
- Barry?
BARRY:
- Adam?
ADAM:
- Can you believe this is happening?
BARRY:
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
(Barry flies down the stairs)
 :
MARTIN BENSON:
Looking sharp.
JANET:
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
BARRY:
Sorry. I'm excited.
MARTIN:
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
 :
A perfect report card, all B's.
JANET:
Very proud.
(Rubs Barry's hair)
BARRY=
Ma! I got a thing going here.
JANET:
- You got lint on your fuzz.
BARRY:
- Ow! That's me!

JANET:
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
(Barry flies out the door)
JANET:
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
(Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
newspaper)
BARRY==
- Hey, Adam.
ADAM:
- Hey, Barry.
(Adam gets in Barry's car)
 :
- Is that fuzz gel?
BARRY:
- A little. Special day, graduation.
ADAM:
Never thought I'd make it.
(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
BARRY:
Three days grade school,
three days high school...
ADAM:
Those were awkward.
BARRY:
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
ADAM==
You did come back different.
(Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
ARTIE:
- Hi, Barry!

BARRY:
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ADAM:
- Hear about Frankie?
BARRY:
- Yeah.
ADAM==
- You going to the funeral?
BARRY:
- No, I'm not going to his funeral.
 :
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
 :
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
ADAM:
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
(The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
highway)
 :
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our regular day.
BARRY:
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
students)
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
 :
- Well, Adam, today we are men.

ADAM:
- We are!
BARRY=
- Bee-men.
=ADAM=
- Amen!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Hallelujah!
(Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
ANNOUNCER:
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
 :
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
DEAN BUZZWELL:
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
 :
...9:
 :
That concludes our ceremonies.
 :
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
ADAM:
Will we pick our job today?
(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus)
BARRY=
I heard it's just orientation.
(Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically
loaded into the buses)
TOUR GUIDE:
Heads up! Here we go.

ANNOUNCER:
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
BARRY:
- Wonder what it'll be like?
ADAM:
- A little scary.
TOUR GUIDE==
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
 :
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry:
This is it!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Wow.
BARRY:
Wow.
(The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive
complicated Honey-making machines)
TOUR GUIDE:
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
 :
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
 :
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
 :
Our top-secret formula
 :
is automatically color-corrected,

scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
 :
into this soothing sweet syrup
 :
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
EVERYONE ON BUS:
Honey!
(The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
ADAM:
- That girl was hot.
BARRY:
- She's my cousin!
ADAM==
- She is?
BARRY:
- Yes, we're all cousins.
ADAM:
- Right. You're right.
TOUR GUIDE:
- At Honex, we constantly strive
 :
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
 :
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
you can hear him groan)
 :
ADAM==

- What do you think he makes?
BARRY:
- Not enough.
TOUR GUIDE:
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
wearing a finger-shaped hat)
Barry:
- Wow, What does that do?
TOUR GUIDE:
- Catches that little strand of honey
 :
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
ADAM:
(Intrigued)
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
TOUR GUIDE:
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones.
But bees know that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
 :
But choose carefully
 :
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
(Everyone claps except for Barry)
BARRY:
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
ADAM:

What's the difference?
TOUR GUIDE:
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
 :
in 27 million years.
BARRY:
(Upset)
So you'll just work us to death?
 :
We'll sure try.
(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
home together)
ADAM:
Wow! That blew my mind!
BARRY:
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
 :
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
ADAM:
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
BARRY:
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
ADAM:
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
 :
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

[b]Resum: Jugueu a Football Life 2024[/b] (www . pessmokepatch . com / 2023 / 09 / spfl24 . html)

He provat el joc unes hores gràcies al cap de setmana de joc gratuït de Gener del 2024.
L'últim FIFA que havia jugat amb regularitat abans del canvi de nom de la franquícia fou el FIFA 18. L'altre dia revisant la nova aplicació d'EA per escriptori em vaig informar que hi havia jugat 1008 hores. És un joc que tot i allunyar-se bastant de la simulació i apropar-se molt més a l'[i]arcade[/i] em divertia prou com per seguir jugant a estones.

L'EA FC 24 em sembla una evolució d'aquell joc. I això no és necessàriament quelcom positiu. Han passat bastants anys, i és en essència el mateix joc, però m'ha resultat molt menys divertit. Hi he detectat moltes més animacions. D'algunes curioses com que els jugadors es col·loquen les mans al darrere automàticament quan defensen dins de l'àrea, que ajuden a millorar la versemblança amb la realitat. D'altres amb una intenció, entenc que més pràctica com les diferents formes d'acompanyar la pilota amb els peus mentre s'avança ja sigui caminant o corrents. Però de fet, no aporten canvis substancials. 
El joc continua sent totalment [i]arcade[/i], fins al punt que em sembla encara més [i]arcade[/i] que a l'edició anterior que havia jugat. És molt difícil simular el futbol real, moure la pilota correctament, fer la passada en el moment correcte de la desmarcada, etc. perquè al meu parer la intel·ligència dels jugadors del mateix equip no controlats per l'usuari no actua simulant la realitat en dificultats mitjanes. A més a més en dificultats elevades els rivals, l'equip no controlat pel jugador, son completament perfectes i en dificultats inferiors simplement no competeixen, van caminant pel camp badant boca.
Tot i provar les diferents tàctiques de plantilla que ofereix el joc, un cop al camp les diferències són ridícules. Els davanters queden totalment en línia amb els defenses sense oferir desmarcades, el migcamp no es mou i els defenses actuen de manera automàtica. Defensar és complicat i requereix d'una precisió incòmode ja que la càmera és massa lluny de l'acció, i ho ha de ser per poder veure tot el camp, canviar a una càmera més propera, fa que es perdi el joc tàctic per la visió reduïda, i tampoc millora massa l'habilitat defensiva. Caldria replantejar, al meu parer, la interacció necessària del jugador perquè senti diversió enlloc de frustració a l'hora de defensar. 

Penso també que el joc està excessivament pre-configurat o automatitzat. Les accions del joc no son el resultat d'una simulació lliure sinó que tenen paràmetres (interns, amagats darrere de línies de codi) que controlen les possibilitats de manera, al meu parer, artificial. Això fa que en ocasions sigui frustrant jugar-hi i per tant redueix forçosament la diversió. Així com també genera situacions absurdes o injustes. Jugadors ràpids que van lents, jugadors amb menys massa muscular que d'altres que guanyen xocs físics sense problemes, jugadors baixos amb poc salt que guanyen de cap a jugadors més alts i forts, etc. No és la norma, però tampoc l'excepció, ocorre més sovint del que pot semblar. He de suposar que la raó no és manipular als jugadors per a que acabin prenent segons quines decisions ja que les coses no surten com la majoria s'esperaria al camp, sinó un desenvolupament maldestre. Sigui quina sigui la opció, l'empresa no queda gens ben parada.

Podria seguir parlant del joc sobre el camp en sí, però sento que no acabaria mai així que seguiré amb un breu comentari sobre tot el que hi al voltant. 

En resum: És lamentable. Fa vergonya.

Modes de joc completament enfocats a que infants i joves dediquin el temps a apostes encobertes amb guanys ínfims i ridículs en una espiral d'addicció que pot arribar a provocar traumes, entre d'altres patologies greus. I tot gràcies al sistema capitalisme en el que vivim actualment. Només fa ganes de vomitar. Modes de joc com el mode de carrera o d'altres continuen amb el nucli igual que al FIFA 18, amb petites adicions que al meu entendre, el tornen més feixuc enlloc de més divertit. I comentar que continua la norma de que els jugadors menors de 17 anys no són al joc i que no tots els equips compten amb llicència oficial, destacant sobretot equips italians.

Finalment dir que el primer que vaig intentar fer un cop el joc havia acabat d'instal·lar-se és jugar una temporada de [i]LaLiga[/i] amb el F.C. Barcelona d'enguany (2023/24), ja que sóc soci del club i encara hem de competir en aquesta Lliga del règim a falta de lliga Catalana oficial. Bé doncs, la meva sorpresa fou que no és possible. Només s'hi poden fer competicions (no estic parlant del mode carrera) amb les plantilles de l'any anterior, però no de l'actual. La decepció va ser gegant, però tot i així, vaig aguantar i vaig dedicar-li unes hores més. Hores avorrides i perdudes.

L'única cosa positiva que n'he tret és que m'ha fet cercar alguna alternativa vàlida i l'he trobat. Es diu Football Life 2024, una versió molt adaptada, actualitzada i millorada del Pro Evolution Soccer 2021. Una iniciativa d'un entusiasta de Palestina/Jordania que amb un grup de persones d'arreu han aconseguit oferir una gran alternativa als que ens divertim simulant el futbol de manera digital.",2024-01-23 20:07:29,False,2,0,False,True,False,0,3,684,684,684,2024-01-20 22:38:00

156592188,english,"The fact that people say that this game is unmatched in terms of beeing the most realistic football/soccer simulator makes me laught. After playing for 2 years EFootball and not touching FIFA/EAFC for that same amout of time, made me realize that the players look like they are wearing roller skates when dribbling not mentioning that the pitch looks small compared to EFootball / real life. The fact that in this game I felt I had no space to pass or to run compared to EFootball is insane. 
Compared to EFootball its way more easy to score goals, i think i had no game that were scored less than 4 goals wich makes it feel unrealistic. But I cant say I didnt have fun playing it, I had a good time playing it, and I think that all this are just personal preferences.
As the last game I playied was FIFA 22 I can say I prefered that menu they had before rather than this one in UT, because in this one I felt kinda lost and didnt like the way the things look so ""hidden"". 
In player carreer wich was the only gamemode I played besides UT, I liked the fact that they made some use of the money that the player has wich doesnt make us feel like we are playing for free or for nothing.

I still reccomend this game for the people who prefer a more arcade football/soccer simulator or want to play any type of offline mode or even the other modes they have as in terms of offline free games like EFootball do not offer anything like that.

PS: I tested this on the free weekend but as I prefer EFootball I will not buy it.",2024-01-23 02:26:38,True,1,0,False,False,False,60,11,798,798,798,2024-01-22 05:32:53

The fact this game has been discounted once to 50% during the winter steam sale, and now to 70% off with a free weekend, should tell you all you need to know about how EA feel about its health - and audience about its quality.

In short: Same old, same old. 
The game is still trash.

The launcher will sometimes take 5 minutes to load, often won't load at all, and sometimes ncrash or have you looking up weird recipes on how to make it even run. I had to install the game twice just to get it to run a second time.

Performance on pc is still a disaster with huge FPS drops when you pause, when you have to take a corner kick, when there's a goal and the replay comes up, when you sneeze, when you're playing on a day that ends in 'Y'.

I only got to try the career mode and a kickoff so I'll only comment on those. Career mode has some new twists in ""play styles"" and other stuff I really don't know if I understand fully.
Practices got revamped so you aren't interrupted every 2 days for a practice session to just button mash ""simulate"" - which is amn improvement over something ooit's still amazing was even approved for the last game -- now you simply decide on team-wide or plpayer-specific ratios of performance and rest, which is in all fairness a much better take and a valid improvement. You can also do a practice session before a match for some sort of temporary boost - didn't try it though.

Players have ""playstyle"" modifiers, which sound good on paper. In pracftice it's... confusing? Randomly an icon will appear over their heads to signify.... I'm not sure? 

I can't really tell this ghame apart from Fifa23. Playters are still magnetically attracted to each other without touching, defending is still terrible, players are still pleased as punch to give the ball away and keep running after another player who was near them politely asked to take it from them without even a tackle, corner kicks are still meaningless and speed and finishing are the only attributes you should care for.

All in all, again: same old trash. I hope this is the last football game EA makes - theiur hearts haven't been in it for ages and we need a new team that actually wants to make a good game that comes close to ""the beautiful game"", not... this.",2024-01-22 19:56:54,False,0,0,False,False,False,0,21,239,239,239,2024-01-22 18:29:27

Played this during the free weekend and mainly played the Career mode. I have not tried other modes nor is interested in them.

Since other reviews reported abysmal experiences on its online mode, I avoided it like the plague.

To force a full offline experience, unfortunately, you'll need to run the EA app while your internet is on first. Once it loads the game, you can yank the cable / turn off your Wi-Fi connection / turn on your firewall which blocks the game from online access.

Recommended to buy at 70% discount or more (even though I'm still having second thoughts since I have no idea whether the game will still work once they put the servers offline). Not recommended if it's priced more.

I know for a fact that PES2018 still works even when its online servers were brought down. If someone can shed a light on this, it'd be greatly appreciated so I know whether to purchase it before Jan 31, 2024 (the sale period).

PS: Aside from FIFA 1997 released by EA, this is only the second FIFA game that I've played released by EA.

Update: Bought the game and discovered the celebratory goal animation for break-dance is broken. Will NOT RECOMMEND any online modes because even with a fiber connection with 400Mbps dedicated international bandwidth, there are instances where the game will hang while trying to update the rosters/match fixtures. Buy only if you didn't own any EA FIFA franchise for the past 5yrs or the past decade.

EA sells the same game every year with different rosters; they don't care about the players at all—the only thing they care about is packs and your money.

A little fat, pimply kid steals his mom's credit card, who works three jobs to feed him and kills you in FUT with the greatest legends of this sport, and there's nothing you can do about it. To earn those players, you need at least 1k-1,5k hours—a classic PAY TO WIN game where little brats heal their insecurities and school bullying by buying players and laughing when they beat you by a large margin.

Secondly, referees sometimes behave in this shitty game as if they don't know the rules. There will be a lot of penalties that wouldn't even be given to Barcelona.

Thirdly, the game is full of bugs. Good luck with that.

As an avid fan of the FIFA series, I can't help but express my profound disappointment with FIFA 24, a game that seems to revel in mediocrity and an astonishing lack of innovation. It's disheartening to see a franchise that once set the standard for football simulation now mired in a quagmire of stagnation.

One of the most glaring issues with FIFA 24 is the blatant lack of innovation in gameplay. It's as if the developers took a time machine back to the last decade and decided that the formula from ten years ago was still cutting-edge. The game mechanics feel tired and overused, with no real attempt to introduce fresh ideas that could breathe new life into the series. It's essentially the same game on repeat, a disheartening reality for those who were hoping for progress and excitement.

The bugs and glitches in FIFA 24 are not mere hiccups; they're game-breaking nuisances that make it clear the developers prioritized a rushed release over a polished gaming experience. From players getting stuck in animation loops to bizarre physics defying the laws of football, it's as if the QA team took an extended vacation. These issues not only disrupt the flow of the game but also highlight a lack of commitment to quality control.

What's most perplexing is the disregard for fan feedback. Over the past decade, there have been countless suggestions and requests for improvements, ranging from refined career modes to enhanced AI intelligence. However, it seems as if these pleas have fallen on deaf ears, and the developers are content to ignore the loyal community that has supported the franchise for so long.

In conclusion, FIFA 24 is a prime example of a once-revered series that has lost its way. With minimal innovation, a plethora of bugs, and a refusal to listen to the voice of its community, it's difficult to recommend this game to anyone looking for a genuinely engaging football simulation experience. Save your money and stick with an older version or explore other football titles that prioritize progress and player satisfaction over a quick cash grab.",2024-01-22 12:28:14,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,21,543,543,265,2024-01-25 14:21:01

156527818,english,"Tried this out on the free weekend. It's a nice game but I'm not sure if it's the game for me.

Graphically, it's a beautiful game with realistic looking players, fans, stadiums, etc. Top notch visual realism despite the occasional quirks like players sometimes celebrating near other players or objects and seeing their arms/legs being unnaturally bent in odd shapes or directions. That you can customize the look of your manager is a nice touch. 

Gameplay, I came into this hoping that it had a deep managerial side to the game. I just want to dictate the orders and strategies and then let the players implement the game plan as best as they can. I don't like having to control and influence players through the use of a controller, to me that defeats the purpose of being a Manager. However, that's how it defaults you. BUT, you can switch to Tactical View of the game and watch from the Manager's sideline box or switch to a spectator cam for a tv-style ease of viewing. In that you can definitely be a Manager and bark instructions to the team via keyboard commands, again I dislike using a controller as a Manager. As far as the gameplay as a player, I didn't do much of it but it seems to be somewhat intuitive though the differences between kicking and passing aren't as easy to grasp as even using the pass button on my mouse will sometimes send the ball far out of play. It takes some getting used to as far as dragging the line to tell your player which direction to run, etc. Overall, for this mode of gameplay I suppose it's fine. But I wanted to play the game as a footy manager. Controller players who will want to control the players themselves should find this mode joyful.

Depth of the game was a bit disappointing. I fully realize that there is Licensing involved as I play a fair bit of other sports manager games and they all have their quirks with feeling incomplete. This game is no exception. While I was excited to see women's leagues in the game, I was disappointed there was no Manager mode for the women. Oddly, even though I can manage men's teams in mode outside of managerial career, such as setting up a custom tournament... I was unable to do that with the women's teams. Very disappointed with that. And while I was surprised to see small footy leagues like Norway's in the game, I was shocked that Mexico's league wasn't in the game. How then can they justify having national teams for countries who don't have their leagues in the game and with no national player pool to draw from while at the same time claiming you cannot add women's management because there's not enough of a national player pool for the women? That reeks of both bias and sexism.

Overall, I think this is an alright game. It's not the best, yet it's certainly not the worst. I would say this is near the top and if improved upon could be the best. I had fun trying it out this weekend and I'm still up in the air as to whether I will buy it or wait and see if FC 25 improves upon this and adds women's management plus more international leagues and competitions for both the men and women as well as a deeper managerial career in terms of expanding on what's here with more leagues, teams and competitions. For what is here, it's still a good game. But I want total football and total control with the ability to coach any gender in any part of the world whether it's China, Chile, or Chicago. I want it all.

For players who enjoy player career modes, this is your game. From what I saw of playing around with it, it looks fantastic for that. For players who want footy manager sim game, there's enough here to give you a lot of enjoyment but you may come away feeling it's a little incomplete or lacking in depth in some areas. Still, I recommend this game because it's the closest we'll get for now to a marriage of a football manager game with phenomenal graphics.

Other reviewers are right, EA gets a lot of hate. Some of it unjustified. I'm an old-timer who remembers when EA was on 5.25"" floppy discs as an Indie publisher helping Indie developers make a name for themselves. They've done a lot for the video game genre and while they've had their shortcomings over the years, I don't see it as being necessary to treat them so harshly when other companies do far, far worse. Besides, there's already enough hate and meanness in this world without my adding to it.

156520774,english,"this game is scam on pc without console controller, you cannot play online without mouse and enemy with controller got 100000% advantage it is impossible to do much with keyboard only as you cannot use mouse but they can use controller
give back fifa 14 or something like that, till it goes back I will always say this is worst football game, go play PES now named eFootball
I must add that I loved fifa 23 and 22 on playstation in gamer pub but on PC this is scam! not to mention the menu for someone new to fifa is outrageous! you need to watch multiple youtube tutorials to even configure and start the game as online mode is hidden as ""seasons"" different in every language

after playing more matches it just takes HOURS of practice to score a single goal in online mode seasons, while I scored lots of goals while playing with bots or in older fifa like 16-18, not only the controls on keyboard feel WAY different it just miss every pass and shot I would 100% do while playing with npc where I won 7-0 (keyboard only) and so on on Amateur or Semi-Pro, you also cannot set left-alt key on keyboard and few others that made me unable to use same config I used in old fifa

I know I would need lots of training to get better, but this game is a joke with controls for keyboard and they allow u to use mouse only on bots (where with mouse I could even get 12-0 on semi-pro), while in pvp scoring a single goal in 100% situation is impossible.. balance is worst ever in this game

This game is the same like my wife, a day is good, another bad...
Yesterday i played on 60-90 FPS ( in corners, celebrations and so one there was about 12 ).
Today i enter, so my maximal FPS on each quality setting was no more than 22-26, in the corners and so on no more than 8 FPS every time.
It is strange thing, i played this game when in Steam was free weekend, and i decided to purchase on discount, after purchasing and files check, game becomes so slow, 
I reinstalled it, read some news about NVIDIA driver update ( that is not so goods ), installed the previous version ( version that worked till i was playing in free weekend) but seems that not the driver is the problem now.
Really, EA, such a big company with a lot of employs and good projects, this kind of bags with your intern mechanic in the game need to be solved in the first weeks with a patch fix... but even now you are not doing anything good.
1 month more i can wait, everybody can wait, after i think i will ask for refund as the game is not playing - especially in career mode where you create your player and play only with him.

First off, connecting to EA's servers is a nightmare. The constant errors and long waiting times just to get into the game are infuriating. It's like you're in a never-ending loop of disappointment. And if that wasn't enough, the EA launcher itself is a source of frustration, crashing every few minutes and disrupting any semblance of a smooth gaming experience.

The game is also plagued with constant notifications that pop up and interrupt the flow of play. It's like you're constantly being pulled out of the immersive world of football that you're supposed to be enjoying. But even if you manage to overlook these aspects, the gameplay itself is deeply flawed. The game runs with a frustrating lag, and it gets worse in online mode, often dropping to a dismal 20 FPS. For a fast-paced sports game, this is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, there's not a single redeeming quality in EA SPORTS FC 24 that can make up for these numerous issues. It's a huge disappointment, especially for fans of the series who expected much better. This game is a step backward in the evolution of football games, and I find it hard to recommend it to even the most die-hard football fans.

While you score the goal there is a chance that the players noclips throught the net.  In career when you picked the fast option where you only play with action, sometimes the game glitches and throws the ball outside the map. (you lose the chance to score). Sometimes also when you restart a match game decides to not let you play and you have to go to settings to switch controls to controller (it's actually real) . Also one time i had a black screen after the half time when i actually saw something it was in spectator mode so i had to restart the match. One time when the ball was out of bounds something popped out on the screen about some player switching clubs the player in question ""-1 undefined"" no face just undefined.

156412349,english,"Having a lot of difficulties with controller support. If I ever get it working I may give a better review. I would be pretty annoyed if I bought this game.
(update) I did get it working, mostly. It still picks up my mouse unless I drag it off the screen and sometimes it randomly won't let me scroll until I move it.

I found a glitch with some of the training drills that it just spams the reset and there's nothing you can do about it. Will waste one of your attempts.

I played career mode and I found another problem with the reward system for wages. I averaged a hat trick a game every game and never got below a 10 rating then I got injured. That's fine, part of the game. What is off is that afterward, I get spam messages from the team managers saying they can't trust my player to be on their team because of my lack of appearances. Not only that but when I do come back and I am only put in the last 5-10 minutes of the game in which I still have a 10 rating each time. I can't get maximum wages or move to a better team even though I've done nothing wrong. I feel like a typical superstar player would be given a little more slack. They have a World Cup MVP candidate and they won't pay full wages and threaten to cut them. Seems like a pretty big oversight. 

The announcers also have like a limit of ten things they say. They don't really even pertain to what happens sometimes, it seems almost random. It's no wonder they couldn't sell this game for 70$ that's insane. I would pay 20$ for it though. There's enough content to keep me entertained for that. 

I've been enjoying learning the mechanics and the game is just as fun as I remember if not a little out of touch sometimes with the AI, which seemed more diverse and creative when I was a child playing.

156403543,english,"Так как играю в серию FIFA с 2010 года, что-то в игре всё таки понимаю. И не буду первопроходцем с мыслью, что EA Sports уже несколько серий кардинально нового ничего не привнесли в жанр. FC 24 это всё та же FIFA 23, которая в свою очередь FIFA 22 и так далее. Купил игру по скидке, решил, так сказать, дать 
 шанс, но нет. Я поиграл в общей сложности 40 минут и мне этого было достаточно, чтобы сделать следующие выводы: в игре есть баги, которые кочуют из серии в серию, например зависшее табло счета (казалось бы, что тут сложного исправить) и это было в первом быстром матче! Физика слегка отличается от прошлой части, но абсолютно незначительно. В Ultimate Team поиграть не удалось: при попытке открыть подарочный пак игра зависла, пришлось перезапускать игру. Второй попытки и вовсе не было, тк висел загрузочный экран с рекламой паков и всё, опять пришлось перезапустить игру. В режиме карьеры кардинальных изменений не нашел, за исключением заявленных: переработана система тренировок и тд.
Посему запросил возврат средств.
Далее моё субъективное мнение как игрока серии более 10 лет:
Мелкие баги, которые знакомы мне еще по FIFA 21, 22, 23 дают понять, что над игрой даже не заморачивались, скопировали код, поменяли составы, добавили пару ""фич"" и вот вам новый спортивный симулятор за цену ААА игры. При чем адекватные студии выпускают патчи, стараясь удержать свою аудиторию, дав ей понять, что им это важно. Здесь все иначе: забагованый аркадный футбол, который каждый год привносит свежую порцию ничего или просто косметические изменения, в этой вот меню переделали (стало как в PES). Я играл в карьеру и UT примерно одинаково по времени и могу сказать, что кроме собственного подогрева интереса игра никак не удерживает тебя в оффлайн режимах (уже во втором сезоне, максимум в третьем становится скучно и однообразно), мол иди играть в онлайн. А в онлайне типичный гринд: выполняй задания, бегай по 24/7, чтобы выловить паки. Но знай, что через пол года выйдет абсолютно новая версия игры, которую еще не видел киберспортивный свет и все по новой.  Пипл хавает, FUT приносит деньги, зачем стараться?
Кто-то скажет, что изменения будут заметны, если переходить с FIFA 22 или FIFA 21, но какое удовольствие играть в серию, поддержка и обслуживание которой закончится уже летом 2024 года, когда составы будут обновлять только в UT. Мне лично такое отношение говорит об одном: EA Sports уже давно не болеют футболом и им все равно: нравится нам или нет.

156389914,english,"Sorry career mode enjoyers. The game is ridiculously easy. Like play a ball over the top of the opponent back line from any distance and just watch them jog to your attackers. It doesn't matter if you are playing Blackpool or Real Madrid. The opponent defense is terribly slow. I've changed sliders, difficulty levels, and it does not matter at all. The one saving grace about FIFA/EAFC is that the gameplay is always pretty decent. It's safe to say it's not for this one. 

Among it's many other problems for the past 8 FIFA games, one of my biggest issues is the anti-cheat. It breaks the game all too often to the point where you cannot launch the game. This game would be perfect on the steam deck too! But you can't even run it on steam deck due to anti-cheat.

156348634,english,"It truly is the worst iteration of Fifa of all time! I've been playing since Fifa 11 and oh how the mighty have fallen! In all honesty your best bet is Fifa 20, 21, or 22 if you want something recent that at least plays well. I'd recommend 21 personally but most people like 22 as well and they're not too different. 

I played 28 min total and I was already incredibly frustrated lmaooooooo.

-FPS is horrendous especially during cut scenes and set pieces (RTX 3070 btw)
-Music just doesn't hit the same and they dishonored ""Love Me Again"" from Fifa 14 by making it the song for this year's opening video
-Mobility feels super clunky and mistimed
-The game takes forever to load even on an ssd compared to past Fifa games
-Don't even get me started on how many times the game stuttered between the menus and the cut scenes
-To top it all off, upon scoring my second goal (around 20-30 min into game time) I was rewarded with the game crashing when I went to celebrate <3

At this point I fear Fifa will fall as far as the NBA 2k series meaning that their last good game will soon have been made 8 whole years ago! Wanna know the best part too? They still have the audacity to incorporate micro-transactions like the greedy gremlins we all know they are :)

The micro transactions are getting out of hand as last year buying packs could only get you so far, but right now it seems like there is always 600k or 500k packs which give you like 100 players. While this wouldn't be unusual later in the game, packs like these have existed for a few months, even when the game was new. I went into this game excited for what they would add, but after realising it was a copy and paste of fifa 23 with women and a different ui that also had more glitches and microtransactions, I will buy ea fc 25.

156324503,english,"I've played Fifa since FIFA 08 and I'm a huge fan of the series but I'm so disappointed. I can't say anything but This is the biggest piece of dogsh1+ I have ever played. I swear since FIFA 19 it's worse every year. The AI is horrible... striker being everywhere but in the box waiting for cross. When defending, I got 4 defenders in my box - literally no midfielder come for help even if there are 4 attackers in the box. The oppenent attackers are scoring the same goals as in Fifa 23... just passing the ball all over my box because no one is actually defending and my defenders are just watching and doing nothing. It's like I need to do everything myself but I can control just one player at once. Then, when I'm trying to switch, I feel like it switches to every player, but not the one who I want to.
I only play career mode and it's incredibly unrealistic when every game is like 5:3 or 4:4. The training is boring, no one actually wants to think about balancing the Energy and Sharpness. It was much better before.
Also the main menu is crap, before it was easier to find everything quickly. And the editing should be the part of menu, not just in the top left corner next to settings. When you are done editing a player, you will get to the main menu and if you want to edit a different player, you need to go back to the left corner and you must find the editing player menu again. Why don't we just stay in editing menu? 
The only thing I actually like about this game is dribbling of players like Messi or Arda Guler - I feel like I'm much more in control than before.
I really tried but I can't enjoy this game. I have played it for the last two days and I also played the beta in the summer but it's unplayable in my opinion... at least the career mode and playing against AI.

Edit: Tried it twice since the original review, I changed the difficulty from Legendary to World Class, to see what will change. I played 3 matches - won all (7:1, 6:0, 5:1). It was easier to defend because I was able to get the ball before they get to my box. The two goals I received were the same situation - 3 of my defenders were in the box, their one striker was totally lonely chilling in my box, waiting for final ball. All of my defenders were 5 metres or more from him and they did not even consider defending or getting to him. I hope that EA FC 25 will have much better AI and it will be more of a realistic game with more realistic score of a match. This can be good only for modes like Ultimate Team but not for career mode. I do not think that all of a sudden since FIFA 23 I am only good in attacking and cannot defend to save my life. ",2024-01-19 22:15:10,False,1,0,False,True,False,0,1,956,956,935,2024-01-22 15:28:40

Congratulations to EA as they have managed to botch another classic.
I just played a couple of kick-off games.
What's new :
Pros:
The cut scenes and intro videos are really good and personal to home team fans.

Cons:
The AI is 'chutiya' ( google it), the players dont know what roles their position requires them to follow, uselessly making runs and giving up space, just to give you an example.
For some reason the pitch is made of ice instead of grass, the players seem to slide from one end to another.
Phil Foden took 3-4 seconds to slide from his own goal area into the opposition's.
The sense of realism is absolutely gone from this title. Feels like fortnite.

Conclusion: Anyone who has actually played football and understands ball will not enjoy this game.

156306838,english,"I tried the game during Free Weekend and the gameplay is terrible. It feels like they only care about graphics, collectibles and customization. eFootball is way better.

I played FIFA from 2002 to FIFA 18 and then I said enough is enough. I only tried 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 during free weekends or free trials and each time I was glad I switched to PES. Playing co-op with friends in PES 2020 and 2021 was the most fun I had in football games for a very long time.

FIFA Pro Clubs were also pretty fun, but it was always difficult to gather a full 11 people squad, so if we didn't have enough and opponents had a full team, we didn't stand a chance.

As for what we play nowadays - eFootball finally added co-op events with matchmaking pretty recently and it's what we play the most. You can play 2v2 or 3v3 using your cards (like from FUT) and the games takes 11-12 cards from each player for 2v2 or 7-8 cards for 3v3. The party leader chooses squad and tactics from all players' cards in the lobby (Game Plan) before the start of the match, so it's really fun to play with your friends' cards.

What's also great about eFootball, all cards carryover to the next season. The game gets updated, you get new gameplay and graphics and you can still play with your favourite players. In FIFA/EA FC when you spend real money on cards, it's gone when the new game launches. In eFootball you get to keep everything (players contracts expire after 365 days, but you can extend them for GP points you get just from playing, I always have way more GP than I need).

And finally, the gameplay is way better in eFootball. I recommend turning down passing assist to PA3 (PA4 is full manual). You have more control of your passes, the ball goes more in the direction you want instead of where the assist wants it to, and it's still slightly assited, so you don't need to set the power and direction perfectly. It gets some time to get used to, but it's well worth it.

Oh, and eFootball is free, I play it since 2021 and I spent only 2€ on coins so far (I wanted specific Zieliński card from a pack and I didn't want to grind for coins then), and from free spins and other gifts or events I already have more legends than space in squad and bench (you can have 23 players in your roster - I have more legends than that for free).",2024-01-19 17:45:05,False,0,0,False,True,False,4029,31,52,52,52,2024-01-19 17:39:31

- It runs horribly on PC. I have a brand new high end gaming PC yet this game stutters whenever there is a cut scene or I press a button in the menus. Some audience textures don't even load.
- The AI is unbelievably bad. They pretty much do the opposite from what a football player should do. Defenders literally run out of the way for attackers.
- Corners and free kicks make no sense. They give you pretty much every instrument to perfect your shot as if you are some ballistics/physics expert with an in build super computer to calculate everything. Yet, it rarely goes where it says it would go.
- There are no tactics at all. Defenders don't hold any defensive line whatsoever and wing backs stay on the outside of their man to defend air I guess. The whole game is pretty much through balls and abusing pace because there is no defensive cohesion in any team.
- Goalkeepers might as well be ghosts. They can't save the simplest of shots. Closing down a 1vs1 with an attacker is also ridiculous. They literally make themselves as small as possible or simply step to the side.
- It doesn't feel like football at all. The pace of the match is all over the place. It can be super slow and then suddenly super fast, but none of the passes, combinations or goal scoring opportunities look anything like a football match.
- The players feel extremely sluggish. It's like you don't have any real control over them. You never know what they are gonna do.
- Every game feels the same. Players and teams don't matter. Just to test it, I played a half star Indian team, of which I can't even remember the name, against Real Madrid. Somehow my 50 rated players managed to outclass Real Madrid. They played like any 5 star rated team, and I was playing on world class difficulty even. I double checked all my settings because I could not believe how bad the AI was. The only way Real Madrid scored was because of atrocious AI defense and non-existent goalkeeping. It was incredibly boring to play.

So again: DO NOT BUY. This game should be illegal. Not just because of the predatory gambling practices in FUT, but simply because it's utter trash. If someone would offer me this game for free, I'd pay them to destroy it.",2024-01-19 15:31:27,False,1,0,False,True,False,0,5,111,111,111,2024-01-19 15:08:10

You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

→ Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
→ Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
→ Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
→ Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
→ Controllers not working properly.
→ Game keeps minimising on PC.
→ The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
→ Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
→ Objectives not counting.
→ Not getting XP when completing objectives.
→ The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
→ Stuck in half-time animation.
→ Game-play stutter.
→ Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
→ Anti-cheat error message.
→ Media questions still make 0 sense.
→ Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
→ Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
→ Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
→ If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shocking, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring back and market as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",2024-01-19 04:46:44,False,29,0,False,False,False,14,55,28,28,28,2024-01-19 04:46:04

It's a FIFA game with a gimmick of ""Hypermotion"" which for some reason is touted as something so special, but does nothing to actually change the gameplay from any FIFA game.

Same issues as FIFA 23 interestingly enough (played that during the free weekend also).
- Frame hitches
- Alt-tabbing/Clicking out of the game breaks the settings menus (eg. ""Game Settings"" and the tabs in those), and you can't move up or down until you alt-tab enough for it to work again.
- Default FPS choices are really weird
- Commentary on goals are so generic, actually heard a couple lines repeated
-- As a small plus though, on a break-away, the 2nd commentator actually had an interruption for the main one when I was running for the goal.

Played a few games and went through the training portion of the game. This is a view from a short playtime though a bit too long to get a refund, my mistake there.

While I enjoy football games and previous iterations of FIFA this version is very similar to all other versions played with very little in the ways of improvement. If you have an earlier FIFA game, might as well continue unless you're after the most recent transfers and such.

Sadly there are a fair few bugs on the PC/Steam version:
1. Laggy/Jumpy cutscenes/celebrations
2. Training commands keep repeating during practice sessions when they have told you several times before.
3. Running animations in character creation look terrible with skeleton issues.
4. Mouse and controller constantly fight each other on menus. Even when you move the mouse off screen when you finish a game or open a menu it resets back to the centre of the screen to begin a fight again.
5. Controller inputs on the bumpers and triggers tend to be hit an miss as to whether they get recognised.

156232227,english,"So i played some Fifa games in the past like the original Fifa Street, 09, 12, 13 and 14. So compared to those i think gameplay (when it's good) is better. But, there are many faults with this game. Random connection losses not due to my internet, UT is crashing most of the time when trying to buy players in the club or SBC Club section, menus being slow and way slower than normal at times, the gameplay is very inconsistent a lot of the time with players being slow at shooting or passing the ball and some passes not hitting at all (This is a reoccurring issue from the previous installments from what I've heard 20, 21, 22 and 23). If you can get over those issues it can be a great game, but most of the time it kinda sucks the joy out of it. Would i recommend this game? Maybe, if you're trying to play the game competitively while taking it very seriously, i wouldn't recommend it, that will just end up in you breaking your equipment which is not a very good economical decision considering the game is already 70€ (which is kinda overpriced for what you get). For casuals? I would say you can have some joy in this game, but it has definitely lost it's shine over the years and has become more and more pay to win since last i played which was Fifa 14. I hope they redo the spaghetti code this game runs on for the coming installments in the series, if not i wouldn't say it's worth copping unless you have a pack opening addiction.",2024-01-18 14:50:57,False,0,0,True,False,False,233,4,19054,1899,17155,2024-02-01 14:08:13

156160598,english,"Another year another...wait a minute! Seems like FIFA and EA Sports are ending their partnership and that comes with a name change.. but what else?
Oh well they lose the FIFA brand but not the licensing portfolio which means the game will continue to be same  ,,FIFA'' we play every year which is a good thing this time.

There's a variety of game modes we're familiar already with,personally i miss the Alex Hunter journey or something similar oh well i guess all good things comes to an end.

Playstyles makes the difference this year between players, now it spotlight stars even more and they stand out from the rest. It's a new mechanic that is implemented for those with special talent allowing them to shine and make the difference. 

Theres subtle additions to gameplay, some changes in Career mode ,Volta football but at his core the game remain the same as in previous Fifa titles.
Ultimate team of course got improvements because it's the game mode that brings the money from microtransactions. But you don't have to spend a dime ,you can earn good players from squad building or earn coins from challenges or matches which you can use to buy what you want from transfer market.

I'm glad they kept Volta football,it's a fun street football mode.

On a positive note,even with their departure from FIFA brand they didn't lose content .
And now about rivalry. Looking at you Konami,it's true your game is free but at what cost?

Hate to say it but even if it's the same game from last years ,it remains the best football game on the market.

Pros:
-PlayStyles
-Hypermotion
-Improved Career mode,Ultimate team
-Volta Football is fun

Cons:
-we won't get innovation and large improvements until next-gen consoles arrive

156077779,english,"Awful, a disgrace, an attempt of what Fifa once mean.

The game has the exact bugs from Fifa 23 and even more.

The UT has 4 game modes (Division Rivals/Squad Battles/Fut Champions/FutDraft) and every game mode feels different, the players move differently, the players seem to have different stats, u have to learn 4 different games to play it.

Most of the players have fake stats that doesn't apply in game, for example, every CB with 80+ pace can easily catch a striker with 99 pace.

Every shot from outside the big area is goal, or at least 95% of the shots.

The women are overpowered, most of them have stats better then the big players that we now nowadays.

The objectives are always bugged, saying that u have completed some, and then u go redeem it still stays u have to redeem.

A lot of times the images in the player cards are bugged, and appears the card without the player, or with 2 players.

Once icons were like an achievement, something that make us feel good and powerful because it was hard to get them, now there's like 20+ SBCs of icons, most of them easy to complete and they give tons of them also in the season pass so icons now are like normal players.

There's one specific graphics definition (the one specific to the hair) that causes you to lose a lot of fps in cut scenes, like you are playing in 144+ fps and drop to 20.

The gameplay is a disgrace, with bugs every match and the AI is just terrible and stupid most of the times and make it so that you suffer goals in the most ridiculous possible way.

Basically, i play Fifa since Fifa 07, and i saw the game having his ups and downs but nothing too serious, this one is the perfect example of a bad game where u have one previous with problems and instead of fix the problems to launch a new game, u launch it with even MORE problems.

Makes moves I can't fathom and even the best players I have in the game feel like they're running on a treadmill at level 1 against players of the same level. It makes no sense.

I will never recommend this game to anyone and I will never buy a FIFA game again. I went against myself this time by hoping something would be different but not again.

FUT:
haven't played for a good while, personally just dont enjoy the game and it make me rage a lot so i stop playing it for the benefit of my own setup. for the short amount of time i did play it, i raged like last year so

Manager career mode:
pretty much the same as last year just more annoying, im sick of making changes i was asked to make and the same fucking week my assistant manager telling me it's not working, I change it back and they say the same thing. another thing is that im being told to change the plans of certain players because they arent playing yet they started every single match aside from a cup match against charlton.

Player career mode:
a lot better, i love how you can actually choose what team you can go to

general things:
first off I hate how glitched and unrealistic the crowd can be, like please give the option to turn off flags for teams that don't have them irl, another thing i hate is that when you create your own team and play in away kit, the fans all wear the away kit aswell which makes no sense. final thing is that half the time nearly everyone in the main stand is wearing the teams shirt which again, is really unrealistic

- I thought hackers were non-existant, no. I met then, leading 3-0, they requested for a pause, suddeny my game crashes (Such Alt+F4) and never happen before.

- SBC? More like money donation, EA = Capitalism

Good job EA! Releasing a new FUT promo every week demolished the usability and price of normal gold cards within the first two weeks of release . It is so obvious that EA are doing this because the player base has largely decreased as compared to previous FIFA titles. Yea, now that you have a new promo every week, more players will invest in your stupid store packs.

155253450,english,"For reference, I am running this game on a high end gaming PC.
I have played almost every FIFA since FIFA 96, and it's no secret that EA do very little to change the games each year, but this year's edition really takes the price for low effort from EA. It really does feel like this is a BETA edition and we are still waiting for EA to release the finished game. EA football fans must have becomes accustomed to half finished games, otherwise there would have been an uproar. CDPR received so much negative press for their disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 release, a game they then spent a long time fixing to give the fans what they initially promised. Trust me when I say, this launch is much worse than CDPR's, and it has already been four months and no sign of EA trying to fix anything. I also find it an insult to the fans that a game released in 2023 is adapted to run on a severely outdated PS4, it shows how little effort EA have put into making it the best game possible, they just want to make money from it. 
They have as in previous versions, taken the predecessor (FIFA 23) and edited it, which should have been fine as FIFA 23 is a decent game, but the decisions they have made along the way are terrible. Everything seems like it's geared towards the features where they can make money from microtransactions, and the features that made the game so popular over the years have been neglected. Manager career mode is plagued with bugs, features that don't work, other features that instantly forces CTDs. Player career mode is really lackluster as your CPU controlled team mates act the same as players you don't control while you play the whole team, meaning the defenders sort of just run along with the attackers but don't actually try to take the ball away from them. There is no possible way either of these features passed any sort of testing phase in the EA developing office.
There are a ton of other issues as well that shouldn't have passed any testing, the pitch weather and lighting can completely change as the ball goes out for a throw-in or goal kick. Giant blocky shadows appear and disappear during game play, I've had random players freeze in place while the game still moves on and the other 21 players move just fine.
If all the issues and unfinished game play wasn't enough, there are also really odd additions. The lighting in the player creation screen now comes from the side rather than head on, so you can only clearly see half the player's face, another feature that shouldn't have passed any testing. As usual, the game is designed to simulate a TV broadcast, so why did they have the referees hand out cards in first person? You go from playing in third person to suddenly see the view from the referee's eyes. why? The game is full of these odd decisions. 
I highly recommend you stick to FIFA 23 or football games not made by EA. I would say wait until EA fix this mess but I really don't think they have any plans to.

155209273,english,"I've had a couple of hours of this brown gem of the gaming industry...

Issues experienced in ONLY 6 hours of playtime, which makes me stop playing it:

7 CRASHES:
- 4 crashes of the anti-cheat with ""117"" error code in the middle of a Rivals match, assuming that I am suspiciously cheating when I never dare to cheat, as I've spent a lot of money, probably over £1000.- on my games and skins on Steam and EA both.
- 3 random crashes without any sign or error code; the game just simply disappeared into the fog.

RANDOM CONTROLLER DISCONNECTS (HAPPENED 3 TIMES):
- While I was able to use my controllers Xbox button (the big X with the light) and inputs worked outside of the game, the game showed me a message that said my input device is disconnected and I had to restart the game to make it work properly again.

GAME IS STUCK:
- Once I was in the menu, the game did not respond to any of my input except the one that opens my friend list, the right trigger.
So, I was not able to navigate in the menu, neither with my keyboard, so I had to ALT+F4.
Sometimes, the game also stuck on start-up; FC24 image comes out, but the game would not launch at all.

STORE NOT WORKING:
- I also experienced some problems in the store.
I am not sure if it is a network issue-related problem or if it was a local issue, but I was unable to order any packs until I restarted the game.

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
- I am playing on a high-end PC (Ryzen 9 3900X, RX 7900 XTX, 48 GB RAM, bunch of m2 SSDs), and I had a lot of FPS issues and stuck/stuttering, especially when I had the cinematic after a goal, missed chance, or the referee giving a card cinematic.

I have a couple of hundred hours in FIFA/FC or whatever it is called, but what I can see now is that this game is going down a slide and getting worse and worse every year and draining funds from the players, but don't misunderstand me, I also bought the game AGAIN, even after a decision when I said I will not buy it again, so there is no lazy/get used to it company without a horde of sheep to burn their money.
My personal peak was the 21, and the 22 was alright of the latest EA football games, but it was also very annoying sometimes with the bugs and the overpowered players like Fekir, Ben Yeder, etc. However, 2007 was the one I was really in love with.

This one, the 24, has a lot of issues and these issues are the same from year to year.
I believe that most players would be happy if these problems were finally fixed, and we could play with a smooth and issue-less game. 
Maybe try to do less, but better.

I know I did not even talk about my personal experience, which was alright.
The game, on its own, is fine-ish.
Players are extremely slow in my scenario and I cannot enjoy the defending, which is barely possible most of the time as the players are running everywhere and when they have to act with a slide or step in or anything, it is really hard to control them in the right way.
The game flows well, by the way; overall mood is okay; sometimes it feels like you are playing football.

Personal best thing during game-play:
Hyper-motion stuff, nice analytics and visual invention give a lot to the game.
I like the half-time animations with those walk-in to the changing room and warm-up animations.

Personal worst thing during game-play:
Power shot Zoom in makes defence even harder.
!!!NOT A GAMEPLAY MOMENT, but I hate the new MENU.. Any another menu structure would be better than this.. too complicated and every step has a loading time, also navigation is so hard that I would rather solve a rubik's cube than starting a rivals match and I does not even have a rubik's cube at home, so I will have to go to a shop first which opens at 9am and it is 7:45am at the moment (I do not know how to solve a rubik's cube by the way)..

I would recommend buying this game because I want a better FIFA/FC again, and I know it requires a lot of funds, even more than what we've paid already with the packs and for the games. But I would not recommend buying this game because I feel like I am being robbed every year, paying for the same game again and again, and the ears of the developers and/or publisher do not hear our words. I will definitely not buy this game again, rather try my friends or simply watch a stream of it and make sure my issues are resolved before buying. I do not own the 23 for the same reason, but I had to give a chance to the 24, but I've already regretted it.",2024-01-04 08:50:15,False,0,0,True,False,False,233,3,372,0,364,2024-01-04 09:36:16

155172597,english,"Where do I start here? I have been playing fifa games on and off for many years.
This game has quite some things to offer that would make it a good game. However, there are way too many flaws that hinder this from being a good game. At the end of the day, gamplay is the most important aspect (or should be...!) - but it seems EA is more concentrating on flooding the community with outside gameplay content, instead of working on the core issues of this game.
No. 1 and the most important for all plattforms:
Inconsistend gameplay - games where players turning luck trucks, take extra unnecessary touches, despite passing / shooting / skill move / direction change has been triggered for ages. This may all come down to lag compensation for me, as I have a stable good internet connection with about 20 ms latency to ea servers. But whatever the cause of this may be, this makes this game not enjoyable, even frustrating at times. If it is lag compensation, even worse, as this would mean people with good internet connections get punished (and put at a disadvantage) for the sake of people with lousy connections.
No 2. especially for PC users:
Awefully optimized for PC!! Same problems that constisted already in previous versions persist. Obviously EA is not interested in spending any resources into making this game decently playable on pc. I am running on a 7600X with a 6950 XT GPU and yet my graphics card is taken to to limit when just entering the menu. If you have set up 120ish fps or higher, the game runs at the same fps in the menus, let alone you unlimited the fps, which bring the FPS to 400 / 500 fps in the menus with 100% GPU utilization. Thing is, the menus are even harsher on the gpu as the actual gameplay is, which is beyond ridiculous. Then there is the mouse bug that hasn't been fixed from previous alterations, where you cant click buttons in the menu, as your mouse reappears in the middle of the screen occasionally.
No 3.: obviously blatant pay to win mechanics, nothing new here. This is only half way to blame on EA, the other half goes out to people spending money for digital content on this game. This is naturally everyone's decision, however to me this is beyond insanity.
No 4.: Bugs & Missing convenience
Just a few examples of what I mean by that:
- When you have duplicates, you can't buy players on the market via the smartphone app, ingame on the pc that is no problem.
- Simply missing obvious helpful options, such as limit player search to a certain ratio rating (e.g. 75 - 80) or
a function to select all you duplicates for a SBC, other than remembering each and everyone of them and searching and selecting them one by one. I can't understand why such easy functions are not in the game.
- Various crashes when tapping out of the game
- Game sometimes just freezes and crashes on the transfer market

This is written by a casual player, winning some games and losing some. For me it is not about just about winning and losing, but the experience in the process.

Hope this helps some people out making a decision on whether or not they should buy this game (let alone invest money for digital content).

Cheers

155145926,english,"The game mostly remains a repeat of Fifa 23, carrying over many of the same features masked in newly designed user menus (slightly more confusing to navigate). The gameplay (online multiplayer, Ultimate Team) is fast paced, often times reaching scorelines of 5+ goals, and can seem inconsistent at times in regards to the matchups with other players. The addition of in-game playstyles also adds to this inconsistency, where a specialist trait can guarantee a free kick, long power shot, or other type of goal. On a notable aspect, animations are fluid and the motion capture has been done very nicely in the new Hypermotion V segment. While some will enjoy the smooth movement, seasoned players may find left stick control lacking without the use of the close dribble playstyle.

Overall, its a football video game which most will be familiar with over other offerings, and even if ""Fifa"" isn't in the title anymore, it remains a chill (but bug filled) title that you can grind for hours, or pickup once in a while.

TLDR; Build team of players, run around with ball, put ball in net, repeat.

155045736,english,"So I've waited a fair time to review this product, let me start off by saying that I have enjoyed FIFA for many years, with my first title being FIFA 13. 

I'd not recommend this game to anyone on PC. The reasoning behind this due to the below issues:

- Cursor glitch: physical cursor displays on screen when using a controller. You can disconnect your mouse and it'll still appear on the screen, even  mid game play.

- Poor servers: The servers for AU players are horrendous. I am running a wired connecting from my router to PC and the game states I have 24ms ping at all times. However, this is not the case... I have used a tool on EA's own website to test my connection to the servers and the result came back at over 300ms ping. 

- Game play is one dimensional: Meta has truly ruined this game. You simply cannot enjoy the game by using non-meta players. For instance, in FIFA 13/14, you could use a silver Brazilian team and be genuinely competitive against a fairly stacked team... this is what made the game fun.

- Input delay: The game on PC experiences a heavy input delay, whether the gameplay is good or bad. I do not believe a user should have to search far and wide to find the best settings in a game to experience the game at it's full capacity. Consumers pay for a finished product, not a product that is not optimised for a PC gaming experience.

Furthermore, not to mention the scripted moments within the game. In Ultimate Team, there's dynamic difficulty adjustment, which ensures your players are performing worse than their base states would suggest. There's no need for this in a Football simulator. Not only does it frustrate all players at all levels, it also disrupts the integrity of the game (not that there is much to begin with). 

There are moments when I do enjoy the game, however, these are all enjoyed with playing against my mates.

Please avoid this game.

1. the game forced closed while i manage my club on career mode
2. vin jr pace is 91++ but still loss race with LB that only had 75 pace
3. the game script is made us always loss, sometimes my GK with 91 ovr play very bad, easy ball but cannot catch the ball so stupid, sometime if FIFA want us to loss even mbappe or haaland shot the ball no matter how hard it is the GK can still catch the ball even if GK has 82 OVR...
4. one of the broken fifa ever, content all the same, where is story mode?
5. player careeer mode cutscene its all the same

the best FIFA is 16 and 19 there is no script, if u good u win if u noob u loss.
maybe EA u should copy paste from FIFA 16 or 19 and make it more content.

this FC24 said u need 100gb storage min, but it only take 40++gb, where is the rest 60GB? did EA just deleted the 60gb content? i buy FC24 hoping there is story mode, our player now can talk like human being, no script no broken animation, no stupid movement from team AI. but what i got is the same FIFA like last year with graphic improvment

The only way to enjoy this game is controlling one avatar (i.e. Volta or Pro Clubs) and even there you cannot escape the culpable goalkeeping that will leave you flabbergasted. They literally put a win/loss ratio mid game in career mode which is hilarious that they are acknowledging when they are tuning up/down the acclimated difficulty settings offline.

154826602,english,"It is FIFA. that sentence alone should give you a level of expectation if you've played any previous iterations of this game. however, if it was the usual level of bad I wouldn't write this.

I've played FIFA since 2010 and ultimate team since 2013 and I can confidently say that this is the worst FIFA I have ever played. The worst game I've ever played possibly.

the gameplay has never been slower with the pay-to-win factor cranked up to 11. Goalkeepers may as well be replaced with cardboard cutouts of themselves for all the good they do. finishing that can make you hesitant to shoot inside the box, but bury every other finesse shot after passing from the corner. etc... 

the netcode is horrible and archaic which causes variable levels of sluggishness ranging from walking in pool water to walking in cement mix depending on which time of day you play.

the optimization for PC is laughable with launching the game taking ages, lagging in gameplay after cutscenes that compounds on the aforementioned problems, and the occasional cheaters.

Simply put, I would use this game to torture spies for information. If you are new, stay away. if you are a FIFA or football fan, skip this game or wait for an update.",2023-12-30 19:16:38,False,1,0,True,False,False,0,3,10134,0,8996,2024-01-11 17:51:43

However, with each update, they mess up the gameplay, favoring pay-to-win players and ruining the experience with cheap, no-skill goals. FC 24 was the final straw for me; trusting this company just led to disappointment. The game is so bad that even winning doesn't bring any joy. It was different in the closed beta – losing was still enjoyable.

And don't get me started on how the pack content has gone downhill over the years. You practically have to empty your pockets to make your team slightly better!

The only decent thing about FC 24 is the evolutions, but I bet they'll find a way to mess that up too, no doubt.

154666177,english,"Sadly addicted. Please take this as a warning and a strong recommendation to not get this game. This has more issues than the user interface just outright breaking from time to time or the game deciding your controller isn't plugged in despite being able to use it in the interface and now it's time to use your KB+M in games all of a sudden. I suppose it is marginally better than the game constantly blue screening like last year. There's a lot of weird in this game, and that's before we've got to the show that is an actual match.

This game doesn't feel like football. Your defenders have a knack of just switching off and not defending. Your attackers regularly don't use their apparent stats and start running when you have opportunities to break out and just idly trot instead. Playing online and offline is a joke in and of itself. People in the community say this is just skill issues. But then again anybody who isn't using 'skill issue' ironically is not to be listened to anyway.

Shooting is all dice rolls, the game turns into a quagmire whenever anybody applies any pressure tactics. Playing online can feel okay one moment and then absolutely dreadful the next. It's like there's something trying to constantly tell you your team of icons suck and you need better players. Buy the packs. Buy the points. Roll on the pack weight that's been neutered by adding a whole bunch of other stuff and constant new promos every week of new cards. Buy it all like you want to.

Close your wallet to this and to Electronic Arts.  I will be free next year. I promise.

EDIT: To add on the game issue and crashes I get I forgot to mention. The first being DirectX errors of ""GetDeviceRemovedReason"" is bizarre as I don't have Direct X failures in any of the other games I use. And they're a lot more demanding.

There's also an issue when I go to stream on Discord or to capture some of the dumbest stuff I've seen in the game where it won't capture and the screen goes invisible. Sort it out lads.",2023-12-28 23:52:06,False,1,0,True,False,False,1061,84,7894,3235,359,2024-01-30 21:37:40

154656831,english,"I've been an avid fan of the FIFA series for years, eagerly anticipating each new release with the hope of an improved gaming experience. However, EA FC 2024 has left me utterly disappointed and questioning the direction in which the franchise is heading. Strap yourselves in for a scathing review because this game is an absolute dumpster fire.

Let's kick things off with the most glaring issue - frame drops. Yes, you heard it right. In 2024, with cutting-edge hardware at my disposal, I still find myself encountering infuriating frame drops during crucial moments, such as corners and goal celebrations. It's almost as if the game is punishing me for successfully earning a set-piece or scoring a brilliant goal. These frame drops not only ruin the immersive experience but also affect gameplay, making it impossible to time your actions correctly. Imagine trying to defend a corner or relish a well-deserved goal only to be thwarted by a sudden lag spike – it's beyond frustrating.

But that's not all. The game mechanics feel clunkier than ever before. Player movements are sluggish, ball physics are wonky, and the once-fluid gameplay has been replaced by an awkward and disjointed mess. It's like controlling a group of players who have never seen a soccer ball in their lives. EA FC 2024 takes a step backward in terms of playability, leaving me yearning for the smooth, responsive controls of its predecessors.

The graphics, touted as a selling point, are nothing more than a facade. Sure, the players might look more realistic, but what's the point when the overall presentation is marred by graphical glitches and awkward animations? I've witnessed players contorting into unnatural positions, goalkeepers performing acrobatics that defy the laws of physics, and ball trajectories that defy logic. It's as if the developers prioritized realism in appearance over actual gameplay quality.

In conclusion, EA FC 2024 is a disappointment of epic proportions. It's a regression from previous installments, plagued by frame drops, clunky gameplay, and an overwhelming emphasis on microtransactions. If you're a true fan of the FIFA series, do yourself a favor and stick to the earlier, more enjoyable editions. EA, it's time to step up your game or risk alienating the very community that has supported you for so long.",2023-12-28 21:43:46,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,2,78,0,78,2023-12-28 21:38:28

Hopefully, one day this company will realize that the short term fixes are not going to suffice and the company will have its run of making money, then die out. I hope it does. Releasing the same game every year is ROBBERY. I hope you poor excuses for game developers realize that your company handed off a diamond, and you're turning it to shit. Thank you for wasting your creativity, so other people with better skill sets can steal your job. Sincerely, this game blows harder than the devs alcoholic father taking a sobriety test.

Not to mention, somehow this shitty company was nominated for, ""best sports"" game of the year. What a joke. If that doesn't tell you the company only cares about becoming another Call of Duty type of machine company, you're lost in the sauce. Wake up, you are victim to someones greed. My recommendation? Be a human being and don't support this game. Force their hand. Stop supporting = stop buying their lies (games) til the message is sent. We are not happy with your product, you have a chance to fix that problem, be better.

154422800,english,"EA SPORTS FC™ 24 is an absolute trainwreck of a game, plagued by two major issues that make it nothing short of a complete waste of time and money.

First off, let's talk about the fact that the game cannot even start properly. It's astonishing how a game released by a major publisher like EA can have such fundamental issues. Time and time again, I've tried to launch the game, only to be met with endless loading screens, crashes, and game-breaking bugs. It's like EA didn't bother with any quality control whatsoever. It's infuriating to spend your hard-earned money on a product that can't even perform its most basic function – starting the game!

But it doesn't end there. EA, true to their reputation, has also managed to mess up the microtransactions in the game. You'd think they would have perfected this aspect by now, but no. The inability to purchase Points, the in-game currency necessary for any sort of progress, is laughably frustrating. I've tried multiple times to give them even more of my money in exchange for Points, but the game just won't let me. It's as if they don't want my money or care about their paying customers.

In summary, EA SPORTS FC™ 24 is a total disaster of a game. The fact that it can't even start reliably and the broken microtransactions are just the tip of the iceberg. This game is a prime example of everything that's wrong with the gaming industry – releasing unfinished, broken products and then trying to squeeze every last dollar out of players. Save your money and your sanity and stay far away from this mess of a game.

154396163,english,"Well where to start with this. Its the weakest game EA made about football in the now ended FIFA series that was legendary a while back. 

First of all my review is for the single player of the game as this is all i play but some points may pass over to multiplayer. 

Its been months since it released yet there are so many bugs in it you might as well consider this game early access. I had players play all games in the season and they submit a transfer request for not playing enough. I had a player ask me to take him off for the next game because he was tired (He was) and when i did just that he got angry and wanted to be transferred. The board objectives make no sense sometimes like they want me to raise the average age of the team but also sign young players. Also there are numerous graphical glitches and they show in every game like clipping and pixelated parts of the textures while the rest of them are fine. 

Most of the time i don't feel like i am controlling the players. I can literally feel fighting with the player i am controlling to force him to do what i need. They added thousands of new animations but i feel like now i am getting stuck in an animation for every movement i do causing lots of issues. 
Defending is horrid. All matches i play live end with outlandish scores like 5-6 or 8-6. Every time i concede a goal it feels like i am conceding the same 3 or 4 goals. I also score a lot of goals but they are the same over and over. The game no longer allows variation just grab a fast winger and score. Hat tricks all over the place and no matter what defender i use its the same. The rival team players become like gods at times making it impossible to defend them like powering through tackles and not being fazed and getting insane speed bonuses with the ball and off the ball. I had cases where a player would just get tackled multiple times without loosing the ball at all. I can hear my tackle making contact but he just clips through. Even when i score it feels like i am cheesing the game. Scoring goals is fun but when you score so much they loose their value.",2023-12-25 21:16:00,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,3,4030,448,2515,2024-01-24 18:38:56

I know the game is the same every year, that is why i buy this mess only when it is on sale. But this year might be the first time i will ever decide to just refund it. It doesnt work. It just doesnt work. Im in the middle of a match, and the great and defenitely proper working Anti-Cheat system just tells me i have software installed that could be used for cheating.

Yeah im sure there is a fix, but i dont want to fix it. The gameplay is sluggish, every year it feels worse than before. The UI is ugly and another step back, the graphics are barely an improvement, horrible shadows, HORRIBLE MUSIC!

The incessant focus on microtransactions really irks me it feels like every corner of the game is designed to get you to spend more money. This creates an unfair playing field, where those willing to shell out extra cash gain significant advantages. I was hoping for some exciting improvements in gameplay and graphics, but it seems like the developers fell short in that department. The game feels like a rehash of previous editions, lacking the innovation I was hoping for. What disappoints me even more is the apparent disregard for player feedback, with the game seemingly prioritizing profits over delivering a truly enjoyable gaming experience. Overall, EA FC 24 just doesn't live up to the expectations I had for a fresh and engaging installment in the series.

154144550,english,"I recently had the misfortune of diving into the latest instalment of EA FC24, and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Year after year, EA seems to be stuck in a repetitive loop, churning out virtually the same game with minimal improvements, and the lack of optimisation only adds insult to injury.

First and foremost, the most glaring issue with EA FC24 is the sheer lack of innovation. It's as if the developers are content with recycling the same gameplay mechanics, graphics, and features from the previous iterations. The promised improvements are barely noticeable, and any attempts at freshening up the gaming experience fall flat. It's disheartening to see a franchise with such potential stagnate in this way.

Optimization is another thorn in the side of EA FC24. Despite the leaps in technology and the capabilities of modern gaming systems, the game still suffers from poor optimization. Load times are excruciatingly long, and the frame rates drop consistently, even on high-end hardware. It's baffling how a major gaming company like EA fails to address fundamental performance issues, leaving players frustrated and wondering if their investment was worth it.

Moreover, the in-game microtransactions continue to be a sore point for many players. While EA claims to provide a fair balance between in-game purchases and rewarding gameplay, the reality is far from it. The game often feels like a thinly veiled cash grab, with players being bombarded by prompts to spend real money for virtual items. This relentless push for additional revenue detracts from the overall gaming experience and leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of those who hoped for a more player-centric approach.

In conclusion, EA FC24 is a prime example of a once-great franchise resting on its laurels. The lack of innovation, poor optimisation, and the relentless pursuit of microtransaction profits make it difficult to recommend this game to anyone looking for a fresh and enjoyable gaming experience. Until EA addresses these fundamental issues, it seems like the glory days of the franchise are long gone.",2023-12-22 18:13:49,False,4,0,True,False,False,163,3,91,0,91,2023-12-22 17:18:22

154136354,english,"FIFA 24, along with its associated EA FC 24 features, promised to be a game-changing experience for avid football gaming enthusiasts. However, as the dust settles and the excitement wanes, it becomes evident that the reality falls short of expectations. This honest review aims to shed light on the shortcomings and disappointments that plague this edition of the popular franchise.

Gameplay Mechanics:

One of the fundamental aspects of any sports game is the gameplay mechanics, and unfortunately, FIFA 24 leaves much to be desired in this department. The touted improvements in player movements and ball physics often feel inconsistent and glitch-ridden. Players seem to defy the laws of physics, and the ball behaves erratically, leading to frustrating and unrealistic gameplay experiences.

Graphics and Presentation:

While FIFA has always prided itself on its realistic graphics, the same cannot be said for FIFA 24. The graphics seem dated and fail to showcase a significant leap forward from its predecessors. Character models lack the level of detail expected in a game of this caliber, and the stadiums, while recognizable, lack the immersive atmosphere that should accompany a top-tier football simulation.

Career Mode and EA FC 24 Features:

One of the biggest letdowns is the stagnation in Career Mode and EA FC 24 features. Despite promises of innovation and enhancements, these modes remain virtually unchanged, with minor tweaks that do little to elevate the overall gaming experience. The lack of meaningful updates in career progression, transfers, and managerial interactions leaves long-time players feeling neglected.

Microtransactions and Loot Boxes:

EA's persistent reliance on microtransactions and loot boxes continues to be a sore point for players. The pay-to-win elements undermine the concept of fair competition and turn what should be a skill-based game into a money-driven enterprise. The frustration of constantly facing opponents with superior teams due to in-game purchases is a turnoff for many players.

Server Issues and Connectivity:

No honest review of FIFA 24 would be complete without addressing the persistent server issues and connectivity problems. Frequent disconnections, lag, and matchmaking troubles have plagued the gaming experience, making it difficult for players to enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted session. This is particularly frustrating given the game's online multiplayer emphasis.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, FIFA 24 and its associated EA FC 24 features fall short of the high standards set by its predecessors. From lackluster gameplay mechanics to unimpressive graphics, stagnant career modes, and pervasive microtransactions, the game fails to deliver the revolutionary experience it promised. While the love for football and the franchise's legacy might keep some players engaged, it's hard to overlook the numerous disappointments that hinder the overall enjoyment of FIFA 24.

However, I do have 571 hours on FIFA22.

The gameplay was actually nice. The move to next-gen brought a whole different feeling to the game especially defending. 
Of course there were bugs such as couple of players in my club not showing properly. Literally written ""NOT FOUND"" over their head and saw a white card whenever I tried to scroll through the options of the player (league, position options etc.)

But putting this aside,
Do I think the gameplay itself was good? Yes
Will there be more bugs? Probably
Will I get mad at EA servers? Probably
Does this game worth it's price? Hell no
Will I recommend it if it is on sale? Hell yea

Just make sure you know you are still dealing with EA and bugs will be there. But all in all I will give the gameplay a 8/10 
with all the other bugs this game is 7/10. Just shame EA cares more about how to get more money out of you with packs rather than deliver a finished product.",2023-12-22 14:38:30,True,0,0,True,False,False,36,5,8103,2110,54,2024-01-31 21:27:44

154072509,english,"EA FC 24, commonly known as ""Emotional Awareness Fighting Championship,"" transformed my life in profound ways. Initially drawn to the event out of curiosity, I found myself immersed in an experience that went far beyond mere entertainment. The championship wasn't just about physical combat; it was a testament to emotional intelligence and mental resilience. Witnessing fighters not only showcasing their physical prowess but also their emotional agility and control was inspiring. It taught me the importance of emotional awareness, both in everyday life and during challenges. The strategies employed by competitors to manage stress, fear, and pressure not only impacted their performance in the ring but resonated deeply with me outside of it. EA FC 24 became a catalyst for my own journey of self-discovery, prompting me to prioritize emotional well-being and develop tools to navigate life's adversities with grace and resilience. The lessons I gleaned from this event continue to shape my outlook, guiding me towards a more balanced and emotionally intelligent way of living.

153966688,english,"I've played Fifa almost every year and I also play FUT. I like the feel of dopamine when that final score weigh in your favour. Some wins in Div. 1 / Elite can be a nice dopamine boost before a good night sleep.

But some things have changed with FC24. For FUT, at least (or most, since it's what I mainly play). 

This game has taken the ever-existing ""pay-to-win"" concept to a whole new level. I guess it's really the time to reap that gambling addiction from some mediocre try-hards. What do I mean by that?

Two letters and two-words: ""AI"" and ""brain-dead"".

These two complement each other really well. Why do you even need to ""get good"" when the AI will do all the defending for you? You just need to fork out some money for that high rated icons and maybe VVD and you're set to auto-pilot to victory.

If you were tackled by your opponent, if you have those meta players (read: money) the ball will magically bounce back to your player's feet. Just dribble along the sideline and then the back line and pass to the player waiting in the middle of the penalty box. As simple as that.

Most of the time, you'll experience the brain-dead-over crowding. Tactics? Pffftt... Get lost! 9 out of 10 times, you'll meet with great teams but totally boring generic, non-creative, sweaty-rat-style type of gameplay. Losing to a better player is acceptable and I love it. But 9 times out of 10, you'll lose to crappy things like rebounds, finesses, sweats. 

If you're a sucka like me who can't quit the dopamine rush, then too bad. You'll be trapped in the downward spiral of cannot   putting this game down. Even though it consume your precious time, (and some times, your precious soul).

So, play at your own risk. 😂",2023-12-20 03:00:54,False,0,1,False,True,False,0,1,4534,18,3503,2024-01-20 04:11:21

You guys are nincompoops and know nothing about football even though you interview them and are always around them. Text me or call me I will explain you how football works and especially how players should naturally move on the field. Explain you that just because you rated a player 87 it doesn't mean that 87- rated player will always be scared of him and pass HIM the ball instead of his teammates.

As we get another year of pure focus into ultimate team, EA are consistent on making game play updates that progressively lead to the decline in sales and player count in this game. Every year the game feels sub-par at launch, but 2-3 months into the game cycle after 1 or 2 gameplay updates, the game feels awful and non-rewarding to play. Even in ultimate team, their most anticipated addition with evolution players are now being placed behind pay walls. All they care about is sucking more money from the consumer rather than retaining their true and authentic fan base. Again, I find myself stuck building concept squads for hours in ultimate team menus, to eventually not even play due to the horrid and frustrating gameplay.  Input delay, cheaters and exploiters, potato quality servers to add to it. I would recommend investing your 70$ into some other games that are worth your time because this game is a joke.

YOU - stfu just give review

Review:
game is shit ea dont give a f### about pc so yeah pc optimization is very bad cutscene are not smooth even if you play on lowest settings well cutscene are all same after couple games you will skip them 

free kicks , corner kicks , and other penalties are laggy fps drop like 15 to 30 i play on ultra and i get 130+ fps except penalty kicks and cutscene

sometimes controller does not work cause mouse keyboard overright it so have to remove them both for it to work

i dont have any issue of game not launching

online modes are very competitive if you thinking of playing online you have to learn otherwise 0-11 like me 

last but not least = its pay to win game like most of games these days

if you thinking of buying it dont, buy a ps5 or xbox instead to get better experience otherwise buy if you have a mid setup , even if you have 4090 ti game will still lag in penalties and cutscene other then that game is playable , i am a casual player i see ball and i run after it .",2023-12-17 02:11:33,True,1,0,True,False,False,117,30,5670,0,4961,2023-12-21 20:44:34

Firstly I came back after a two year refusal to buy this game after the poor updates to career mode. I guess this hasn't changed much since the only thing I see different is that you get the option to actually have the club manager as the NPC in the game.

Secondly, the game play seems to have taken a complete step backwards compare to the flow of the game 2 years ago. Just the players seem sluggish in movement and because of this I push harder on the thumb stick which in turn gives me pain in my thumb because of the unnatural slow pace.

I think this is the last EA football game I'll ever be getting, I've had enough of games that prioritise ripping people off with gambling mechanism in games, which is why I never play Ultimate team. It's pretty shameful EA, especially when your market demographic is kids. All games that have a gambling mechanism in a kids game should be told they are morally corrupt.

The game is very similar to FIFA23, which was very similar to FIFA22, which was very similar to FIFA21, and so on. So, if you'd just like to have some fun with friends, just play one of the previous versions you already own, so don't buy this game. 

Moreover, this game still has the same annoying controller bug that FIFA23 has, i.e. sometimes you can't move between menu items and you need to use the mouse. I bought an XBox controller on purpose with the intent not to face this issue again, given that it's the only officially supported controller (which is also unacceptable for a controller-based game), but I got very disappointed.

If you are considering buying this game, please give your money to anything else, or maybe give money to the ANTI lobotomy association in hopes of the EA developers getting the help they deserve. This is by far the WORST game I have played in my life and it is really sad steam allows this pathetic idea that should've been swallowed made it to the platform. I hope EA goes under and the CEO's starve. This game is just horrible and should not have ever seen the light. EA losing the rights to FIFA was a sign from god to end this horrible excuse for a franchise, yet they could not see the massive letters in the sky saying PLEASE DO NOT PLAY. This game should have been looked at for 3 seconds and then executed along with the developers. Please do not let this pathetic game and company trick you into stealing your money for some dog shit worse than roblox soccer game (genuinely roblox feels so much better than this in some of their soccer games) and it is so sad that as a society we allowed this to get more than 1 person playing.

This game have thousand menu glitches that makes you restart it at least couple times everyday. A lot of times the objectives are misspelled and they can't even write words correctly. Every time you load up a game there will be different gameplay. Netcode is shit, you can have op and meta cards, but enemy with random gold rare cb's will smack your strikers and all of their players will perform 3x better than yours. You can be good or decent at the game and you will never pack anything worth 50k+, while most of the time you will play against best icons and hero with first owner. And its not like everyone has at least one card like that in their team and everyone is happy. Some people have two, three or even more top tier cards that are fo in their team form icon packs and hero picks and they have problems with getting 9 wins in wl :) 90% of employee that work on this game are apprentices that have problem with putting correct packs with correct description.

153434721,english,"The game is like every game before it, it's evidently flawed. While it claims to be a football simulator, it's more of an exploit simulator. If you don't conform to the prevailing trends in team composition and player abilities, centered around what is exploitable, you'll find yourself unable to compete against those who do, and you will lose. Learning and executing exploits becomes a necessity, and while there are numerous tutorial videos available, succumbing to this approach can ruin the overall gaming experience. The game's current form, and as per discussions with other players, past and possibly future iterations, is highly exploitable. Consequently, you'll witness only three types of goals in this so-called football simulator. While you may score and witness hundreds of goals like these, the game's rigidity to these play styles and game-breaking mechanics eradicates the sense of being immersed in a football simulator. To wrap it up. Frankly, I anticipated much more from the purported best-in-industry and expensive game. This disappointment isn't solely based on the gameplay; it extends to actual bugs involving matchmaking, glitched menus, automatic configuration reverting, uniform malfunctions, a community rife with sore losers resorting to excessive slide tackles and leaving matches when behind, glitched animations, inexplicable computer decisions, alleged handicapping of matches, and other issues that my friends and I endured to play this game. In summary, and being entirely candid, I strongly advise against subjecting yourself to this experience. I mainly play career mode now and while it’s more enjoyable they didn't really add anything new this time around or ever to be honest. If you do get the game I suggest sticking to career mode if you want to keep your sanity intact. That’s the only way I’ve been able to enjoy it.

Click to continue, choose a profile, select the game mode, and stare at the new microtransaction opportunities. There was an error connecting to the EA servers. Repeat the process and congratulations on wasting 10 minutes getting the game started.

- Finally get into Ultimate Team. A couple of notifications on the objectives tab. Spend another 10 minutes trying to figure out which completed objectives you did not claim. Turns out it was a visual bug that hasn't been fixed for the past X months.

- Check if there are new Evolutions. Pay 150k coins for an evolution to increase the overall rating of your player by 2 if you complete 40 games played. 

- Open the packs given to you for being a loyal customer who wastes time and money in exchange for frustration. Feed your inner gambler.

- Finally have a squad full of players that you wished for even before you purchased the game. Make the tactics that fit your and the squad's playstyle. Get into Rivals and lose matches consecutively.

- Realize you conceded the same goals over and over again and all the teams you played against have players chosen from a pool of 20-30 useful players. 

- Check online what is wrong with your team. Basically everything. There are two working formations with two custom tactics variations and none of your players are part of the meta so they are trash no matter how good or unique they are in real life.

- Become what you hate and mimic thousands of other people playing the same way to compete with them. Spend time and money to catch up with them. Still be mediocre because you cannot keep up with the pace of the game and stick to the same scoring pattern over and over again or cannot accomplish Mortal Kombatlike skill moves where you need to click both L3 and R3 with your eyeballs then do a backflip and sit on a cucumber to accomplish el crochetta de la boomshakalaka move to beat the new Dark Souls boss Virgil van Dijk.

- Get frustrated, try squad battles. Semi-pro, pro, and world class difficulties are like playing against an afk player. Go above that and you wont be able to touch the ball against a 60 overall team that wastes time and mimics the same cancerous gameplay you experienced in the Rivals.

- Try pro clubs with your friends. Get frustrated together.

- Try career mode. Becoming a goalkeeper sounds fun so you become one and sign for a fourth-division team. Get selected for the team. The manager expects 8.0 overall performance from you. Wait in position for the whole game since the other team is not capable of shooting once in 90 minutes which means you did not make a single save and your rating drops to 5.0 from the default 6.0. Get benched in the next game because you did not score a hat trick as a goalkeeper to get 8.0 rating. Leave immediately.

153307570,english,"do NOT waste your money on this game. this game is so boring.

The reason why im saying this is because the main game mode (ultimate team) is so horrendously boring.
-there are so many useless promos that are coming out week after week with no part 2 making the whole game become repetitive.
-basically a gambling game.
-compare the best teams now to the best teams last fifa. big difference.
-fifa 23 and 22 were way better than this in terms of promos and overall look of the game.
-evolutions is a massive disappointment as you have to buy certain evolutions and grind the hell out of them just to get a better card of a useless promo called ""dynasty"" that will be outdated in a few days.
-i played fifa 23 and i actually found it fun and not so much repetitive but also the pack weight was decent.
-the new pack thing is just stinky, instead of it being random, its just more grind induced as its bad bad decent then bad again. (if u get some bad ones, you will get a higher rated) which takes out the luck of getting 2 good players back to back. (i might be wrong on this one)
-useless sbcs that all look the same.
-added females
-DDA which ruins the whole multiplayer game. There is division rival levels for a reason. bad players stay at level 10-7 and good players move up levels 5-1
-DDA also is unpredictable as it can ruin your game streak by either downgrading your keeper to onana right now.
-exploits
-every time i come back, i have nothing to do because either dda ruins rivals and futchamps, squad battles is boring, sbcs is gambling and the game is ptw.
-DONT WASTE MONEY ON THE GAME.

Now i wanna talk about the careers.

- although not getting much updates, it can be fun for someone looking to level up, switch teams, and become the best.
-manager career is fun building a brand new squad from league 2 to the premier league
-player career is fun starting as a wonderkid to eventually breaking records.
-you can do so much with manager career mode like making failed wonderkids great again.

I didn't play any of the other game modes but i heard also some bad things about them

overall dont buy the game. better luck next year if it even changes a bit. ea doesn't give a single shit about the community or the game, they just want money.

If you ever play with someone on console (PS5 probably) the game will become indecisive. Your players can’t even kick the ball even the other player at least 1m away.

If you are lucky you can play with someone else on PC bu that happens one in a hundred.

3. defending in this game is horrible, inconsistent and sloppy.
4. not to mentioned about the goalkeepers... cant even grab any shots which leads to continues parry of the ball which then results in a goal.
5.referees are a forced to be reckon with because is consistently inconsistent as well...... i have received more than 10 red cards in 30 matches and sometimes 2 red cards in a single match.
These reviews are based on the online experience of the games which means "" ULTIMATE TEAM"". if you want these game for manager career its a good game(but i cant guarantee the game play cause this is FIFA at the end of the day). career modes have some new features which really helps in overall experience for the game.

With servers located in Narnia and EA at it's finest every day is a surpise. 
You might be able to play a decent game without de-sync and players flying around once a week.That is if you are not playing on a PC cause well... EA released the mobile version for PC apparently.. 0 optimization. Your high end PC is gonna feel like a 10 years old budget build with this game. 

It does have a nostalgia feeling tho.. If you ever played fifa 94 you gonna love it .. Its pretty much the same with different names. Bugs,garbage graphics and physics and something that looks like football but totally isn't all in one for only 70$!!!

The devs are also working extremely hard to improve the game . They are adding new cosmetics and new 50$ packs almost daily! Now that's dedication! 
Many people would call this sellout but that's just nonsense. 
It doesnt matter if the game is barely playable as long as the card backs are looking sexy and the shop is ready to empty your wallet. 

Overall a great card collecting game for gambling addicts.

Totally wouldnt recommend unless you hate someone. 2/10

153200610,english,"I want to enjoy this game, I really do. There are a lot of improvements made but still a few months after release, nothing has changed. Just some background, I've been playing 'EA FC' (Formerly FIFA) for a few years now - since FIFA 22 and this one has no notable improvements, in fact I'd say it is worse than its predecessors.

What I like: 
-Visually it's stunning, I must say the graphics are a major upgrade and I love how the game looks
-The UI, I love the new in game UI for the premier league and la liga etc. though not so sure about the title screen UI, feels a bit clunky to me.
-Dynamic animations. I love the new dynamic change room animations etc, but in a game as big as the Champions League final I don't want to see a quick few cut scenes, I want longer animations that immerse me and get me excited for the game.

What I don't like:
-The new referee AI is terrible. I usually play career modes and it is red cards galore for what are fairly tame fouls. Moreover, don't even get me started on advantage. Recently in a round of 8 UCL match my player was tackled and the ref continued to play advantage after a pass was intercepted from the person that was tackled, they scored from that and we lost 1-0. 
-No innovations at all. No VAR. Nothing. to be honest it's all the same and that frustrates me to all hell. It's not even the thought of VAR checking decisions - it's the tension laden moments just before a penalty is awarded etc.. Of course if should be skip able but it's the thought that counts.
-No focus on anything other than FUT. The player agent sucks. Yes in some cases its good, but I can't get into the transfer market and see what clubs want me etc.. Manager career still has common sense issues like being unable to cancel a players transfer request even though they are asking for a contract renewal and other issues. All of EA's effort goes into the cash cow - FUT, which for your average player is a total sweat fest.

Those are a few issues, but unless something changes next year, I certainly will not be buying the next game.",2023-12-09 12:29:34,False,1,0,True,False,False,93,5,11911,0,10389,2023-12-25 13:32:52

I initially never bought this game at release, as I wasn't particularly impressed by any of the new in-game features, especially at a 60 pound price point. Now that the game is on sale for half price, I thought that maybe I could get my moneys worth now, but oh...how wrong was I.  To premise this game is absolutely shocking. I seriously don't know how EA have the audacity to re-release what is essentially the same game every year. No new features, other than a female roster. Ultimate team is the same old pay to play stick it always has been, but now there are women players too, further decreasing your chances of actually getting anything good in a pack lol. I genuinely cannot understand how they have the audacity to charge 60 quid for this. I played for 2 hours then promptly released how absolutely dogsh$$ this game is, and have refunded it. If you play ultimate team, and don't mind sinking in a couple of hundred quid to make sure you have the best team, then maybe you can find some enjoyment in that.

Nothing about the AI locking you off from player swapping when the ball is in the air and the AI has decided the player it has selected for you isn't close enough so won't let you move them or even switch until the AI opponent has already received the ball.

Still nothing about the AI randomly nerfing your entire 88 rated squad so they play worse than the 62 rated bronze team who can make slide tackles from 10 meters away at velocities that would break the speed of sound with the rebound homing to an opponents feet 95% of the time.
They can also make impossible passes while your own players have been nerfed so hard they can't even make a simple 5 meter pass to an open player.

Nothing about making AI opponents skate across the ground with their animations playing so they can make up the ground to you when they would have actually been too far away.

Nothing about forcing our own team to use an extra animation or 3 when trying to turn or pass etc forcing us to slow down to a crawl to allow the AI to catch up, literally 89+ rated players playing worse than the worst bronze player in the game

This is simply the laziest attempt at opponent AI I have ever seen in a football game, the goalkeepers feel like they'd be more at home in football manager's replays, the players feel like they're made out of rubber being able to perfectly tackle you from impossible angles and distances.

The gameplay/mechanics, graphics/UI and audio are pretty solid. But honestly, the game modes within UT are boring as the only competitive offerings worth playing are rivals and the weekend league. Why don't they add any competitive public tournaments or something? Now the biggest issue for me is simply the cost of FIFA points and/or the funds needed to complete SBC's and acquire good players. It's ridiculous! If you want to build a decent side, you will have to either spend A LOT of money (£100-£150 minimum from the start). Or put in hours upon hours completing boring challenges in order to acquire one decent pack or player. it's a joke. It's just not right that one decent promo pack in the store costs around £25-£30 and you're more than likely not going to pack anyone that good anyway. It's just morally wrong to charge people that amount of money to enjoy the game to a basic level and build a strong squad.

152895074,english,"Have you ever wanted to play a sports game where the ""athletes"" you are controlling act as if they have never actually played the sport the game is allegedly portraying? Then this is the game for you.

If you try to play a long pass but under hit or over hit the pass(hold down the button the wrong amount of time), then your player will just play the ball randomly to one of your players in a direction you aren't even facing. Much like real life, where when a professional player plays the ball with the wrong amount of pace, it actually goes in a different direction.

If you have two players on your team near each other(which happens all the time bc players in this game make the same exact run as each other even in a 3 v 1 situation), and one of those players is has coverage, it is better to not make the pass at all because you will play it to the opponent who is covered EVERY TIME.

I wouldn't consider Y to be a through ball anymore its actually just the button you press to give the ball to your opponent(along with most other buttons).

L is supposed to shield the ball or jockey your player, and it also scissor kicks every cross that doesn't make it your way. So pretty much if your jockeying for position on a cross you will scissor kick it EVERY TIME. (to be fair, this has been consistent across FIFA games forever, which makes perfect sense considering how often you see people scissor/bicycle kick corner kicks)

If you are caught on the break and the opponent is rushing up one of your flanks, good luck switching to your left back or right back. First you must switch between your two center backs and a defensive midfielder halfway up the field(thinking he's a striker?) 4 to 5 times. Then when you finally switch to the guy who would actually do the defending in ANY real life scenario, the player is beyond him. 

You know when you're watching the prem and its a one on one situation with the keeper and the keeper, rather than actually try to stop the ball, just jumps in the air or throws his arms straight up without moving side to side or trying to make themselves bigger and then the opponent scores every single time?

Again, why does EVERY single player not seem to know what sport they are playing? And its like, you buy a player, knowing what style they play and their strengths (both in real life and according to the game) and yet they act like complete fools. I can not tell you how many times Erling Haaland runs to the corner to receive the ball in a 2v1 situation rather than crashing the box(and I specifically have custom tactics for him to do this), or Christian Erickson can't make a 5 yard pass to one of his two teammates near each other because one of them is being defended.

+ Accessible and inviting gameplay, especially for beginners.
+ Career Mode has promising features that draw players in.

[b][u]Contra:[/u][/b]
- Some illogical elements in Career Mode detract from the managerial experience.
- The game's significant price drop just 5 weeks after release raises questions about its value.

152786511,english,"this is one of the worst video games i ever played, the only reason i played it as much as i did because i was just looking for a football game since i played way too much of football manager, and efootball apart from the gameplay is mostly pretty bad but as for ea fc i am done with this horrible game for now, the ai in ea fc 24 is honestly some of the worst i have seen in a triple A video where they almost never make either good defensive runs / positioning for when your defending or attacking runs and positioning when your attacking,

 but what makes the game play really bad apart from the horrible positioning when your players have 90+ defensive/attacking positioning is where you do basic short passes, and basic through balls to players who are in nothing but open space but yet the ball ends up at the oppositions player regardless or the fact your one on one with the goal keeper 12 times no goals your opposition 4 shots on goal 4 goals, and something also terrible is the fact that when you do a perfect slide tackle you never win the ball the only times you win the ball is if your player has the playstyle+ for slide tackling if they don't then they never win the ball or if they have only the normal slide tackle playstyle they only win the ball like 20% of the time

in this game people are always abusing broken mechanics and play styles that ea refuses to fix, and you want to have fun in any of the game modes like ultimate team, seasons, pro clubs you need nothing but meta pacey players which just isn't fun and apart from playstyles which is very mixed some good some bad and stupid this just feels like a copy paste of last years game but with even worse and less enjoyable content and they didn't add much to either career modes either which still feels stale, boring after all those years,

and in seasons people are always picking the meta teams that have fast attackers like psg, liverpool etc. which gets annoying and boring,

also in ultimate team most of the sbc's are overpriced with horrible pack weight, division 8 is filled with nothing but smurfs and on the rare occasion a cheater,

the graphics and the animations are nice though and it has a lot of content but because the game play is so bad and repetitive with almost nothing new added and people using nothing but meta teams, players, builds it just ruins the game and it's easily a 2/10 rated game that's mainly because it's not fun to play and more like torture.

Graphics so realistic, I've started a virtual apology tour for every unintentional somersault my player does. FIFA regulations apparently frown upon football acrobatics – who knew?

Career mode is a wild ride. Sign a fat contract one minute, get a virtual red card for an overenthusiastic cartwheel celebration the next. Note to self: stick to soccer, leave gymnastics to the pros.

The soundtrack turns your living room into a disco, urging you to celebrate goals like nobody's watching. Just hope your neighbors appreciate your virtual moonwalk skills.

Opposing team's goalie? More unpredictable than a cat on a caffeine bender. I'm convinced they've got a crystal ball hidden in the goalposts.

Minor quibble: my virtual manager holds a grudge. Tried negotiating a better contract; he responded by turning my player into a clumsy tap dancer for three matches straight.

In short, EA FC 24 is a crazy combo of football, dance, and unexpected plot twists.

The microstuttering is so intolerable I had to return it for a refund. Tried over an hour to tinker with the settings to get it right but to no avail. 

This is the first time (in a long time) I tried playing FIFA/EAFC on PC and I must say the overall experience feels very unpolished compared to my experience playing it on console in recent years. There is no controller support for Dualsense controllers. So you get xbox on screen controller prompts while using a playstation controller.

I might reconsider trying this again in a few months if there is a steeper discount and if stability improves. Not sure if that is going to happen though. In the meanwhile I'll continue playing FIFA 23 on my PS5.",2023-12-02 14:55:11,False,2,0,True,False,False,0,5,82,0,82,2023-11-28 12:24:30

The game's apparent downfall lies not only in its uninspiring change in the outlook but, more critically, in its abysmal gameplay. Players have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the overall gaming experience, citing issues ranging from clunky controls to lackluster mechanics. The game's attempt at a revamped visual presentation seems to have fallen short of redeeming its flaws, ultimately contributing to an overall sense of disappointment among the gaming community. FC24's descent into the realm of the worst games in history is a testament to the importance of striking a delicate balance between aesthetics and gameplay to ensure an enjoyable and immersive experience for players.",2023-12-02 08:34:27,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,1,11501,1337,727,2024-01-31 09:47:31

So i decided to make a Tiktok account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. It was all going so well until... I heard a loud thump upstairs. As I walked up the stairs, I saw pieces of what seemed to be a controller shattered across the floor.

If it can load the matches in career mode, why it does not load in other modes. I bought this game in the Autumn sale, for RM120.00. I paid that much just to play career mode only.. I hope EA will fix this issue as soon as possible. Please press read more.

As last attempt to fix this issue, i uninstalled the game, and EA app, and files related to the games. Then reinstalled the EA app and connect with EA account first. Then i download back the game, opened it , lower the resolution, and the graphics settings. Then go into kick off mode, and load a match. To my surprise, the match loaded and I am able to play it.

152555024,english," i played FIFA since i was a little kid... I'll call this game FIFA, there isn't any other company making a decent football game so lets call it what it is. I played 20,21,22,23 and although the game always seem like shit at the start, i get used to it and learn to play it trough its faults. But this year its different, this year the game fundamentals are truly broken. 
            The keepers are the worst I've ever seen, they get baited so easily, don't know how to dive forwards or to the direction of the ball and their hands cant grab a single shot, they defend towards the goal so it bounces in is hands and enters the goal
           Crosses, through balls, simple passes 40% either don't go with enough speed (and an AI computer guy decides to intercept, get the ball counter and score), they don't go to where you directed it or they go to someone you couldn't even imagine of it receiving the ball (making me feel like this pass was pure luck and randomness) or sometimes it feels like its aimed at the opponents players directly.
           When i make a successful  standing tackle does the ball need to be bouncing between feet and end up in the opponents possession again? is this what it feels to be realistic? the feel that anything can happen? if it is then its not the way to go. I want to feel rewarded when i do a good tackle, when i make a good sliding tackle.
            I play seasons, i refuse to play UT because they are two different game modes with different mechanics, and i want to play with the same mechanics when i do a online friendly with my friends. UT its the same play every game, cut back passes in the goal line for a easy tap in, making every game boring and constant struggle to prevent those type of goals.
            The game is less about having a even team with all above average players and more about having that broken guy that shoots a missile or runs and takes tackles like a rhino.
            I will not even dive in to the bugs it was and the freezes and speed ups of gameplay i have since fifa 23 when i try to play online.

This game doesn't give me any joy when i win a match, its all made up to make me believe i know how to play,
m i hating on the game because i don't know how to play? maybe... there are people out there that will win all the games they do, that are truly better. But the skill gap has been so lowered that anyone can have a good game and make 3 shots outside the box in the first 30 min and score all...

This is not named FIFA anymore, i heard that the FIFA will come up with a new game, and there are a bunch more that want to dip their toes in to this market that has been EA's for too long.
I m just hopping who ever is going to compete with EA makes a better job and actually play test the game. 
Because if its the slightest better then what EA has been putting this couple of years ill gladly buy it over this money grabbing company's game.

sent my refund, i hope they accept it.

152509942,english,"Disappointing Experience with EA Sports FC 24

As a long-time fan of EA Sports games, I had high hopes for their latest release, FC 24. Unfortunately, my experience fell far short of expectations.

Firstly, the gameplay mechanics felt unpolished and glitch-ridden. Basic movements were clunky, and player controls often felt unresponsive, leading to frustrating moments during matches. It was disheartening to see such fundamental issues in a game from a renowned developer.

Moreover, the visuals were lackluster, failing to meet the graphical standards set by other titles in the EA Sports lineup. The game lacked the immersive quality I've come to expect, with outdated graphics that detracted from the overall gaming experience.

Additionally, the game's AI seemed poorly developed. Opponent teams displayed unrealistic behavior, making the gameplay feel artificial and scripted. It detracted from the authenticity that typically defines EA Sports games.

The lack of meaningful updates or innovative features was disappointing. It felt like a rehashed version of previous titles rather than a significant evolution or improvement.

Furthermore, the online mode was plagued with connectivity issues, resulting in frequent disconnections and disrupting the multiplayer experience. It made playing with friends or competing against others more of a hassle than an enjoyable experience.",2023-11-29 13:01:01,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,1,23573,1183,12049,2024-01-29 15:19:05

152235727,english,"One of the few games i bother myself to write my honest review on :

performance : the game ran smooth for me but after last nvidia update ( an update before the latest one today ) got laggy af for me on free kicks/corners/ goal kicks etc , i usually score at least 1 of 3 corners but i couldnt do any corner anymore cause of lag and it was aggravating.btw i got it fixed hardly by removing datas (not sure what fixed it cause i did whatever i could like crazy but i guess thats it)

 game play : it looks more realistic to me compared to 23 about the visuals, but tbh 23 felt better for me , i played fifa 23 as first fifa  (i quit pes along time ago ) and i liked fifa 23 and i got connected to it, in 23 i only played seasons, felt good , i got up to division 1 , learnt the game enough for myself not like i could beat everybody but enough to enjoy. then i started 24 and ultimate team, was like hell , felt constantly pressed hard and high up the pitch on the other hand i couldn't defend at all , specially cutbacks , super annoying . they nerfed jockeying couldnt , for me it was like its a whole another game in defense i still enjoy 23 more whenever i play it sometimes, last thing about game play i wanna say is that i thought whatever it is its same for all  ( whether the game got better or not ) so if others are playing and beating me its my problem so i kept playing and learnt it better , still having same problems but its way better for me now xD and btw im enjoying the game overall maybe cause i didnt play better fifas that yaal experienced.

community : what a bullshit bro! in seasons that i played in 23 there weren't many kiddos celebrating their goals for 2 mins :| in 24 its like 6-1 and the guy celebrates and wastes my time for his first goal in a badly loosing game, on the other hand they waste time to win a game , had a game that opponets wasted like 30 mins of the game instead of playing it so i couldnt comeback on his 1 goal .

btw overall im enjoying the game so  i recommend it .",2023-11-27 15:25:39,True,0,0,True,True,False,0,2,25317,0,16892,2024-01-12 01:52:50

DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ULTIMATE TEAM.
A few minutes ago I played what I consider to be my last Champs Weekend for the foreseeable future. 
The scripting I faced in the 5 games I played is honestly unreal.
And there is only one foolproof way to attack that 100% works, which is to run down either flank, do 1-2s and pass it into the net which has pissed me off so much.

I will play this game for Pro Clubs however as I do like that mode and the more human-ness of it, if you can say so. It's just crazy how much Ultimate Team can screw your head over even if you play well. I'd rather spend my time elsewhere. 

If you do want to buy it, get it on sale when its 50~70% off. The full price is not worth it to experience the DDA, scripting, broken ball physics, not given penalties, and what not. Not to mention the way the ""main"" gamemode of Ultimate Team is set up to draw you in to spend real cash to get better in-game ""cards"" or ""items"" which, AGAIN are RANDOMLY GENERATED. There's a word for that and it's called GAMBLING. They just want you to keep throwing money into the game.

I encountered a hacker in one of my games. I reported him to EA and got an e-mail that read: ""We reviewed your report and didn't take any action this time.""
This is how EA deals with hackers. By not banning them, but they do ban people who sell players on the marketplace for maximum asking price. Not only is the max. asking price something EA themselves decide, they are the reason why certain players boom in price.

And don't even get me started with the gameplay, one-way boring meta and mudded servers which is something we have come to expect from EA Sports games, but this year's is the absolute worst. The game just isn't fun anymore, plain and simple. The only ones who still play it are the people who are addicted to the packs and that one in a hundred games that happen in-game that actually makes you feel like a God player. Even though you're actually not, you're just playing a player who has bad connection because EA servers suck.

The only positive is actually the menus. There's plenty to do and plenty packs to grind for without having to give EA money, but trust me, they do try their hardest to make you buy them.

We all know what kind of company we're dealing with by now, but please do consider your mental health before giving them any of your money, because EA absolutely don't care about it and even promote more toxicity in-game making the EA FC community one of the most toxic communities in gaming. It's just not worth it, even at a discounted price.",2023-11-24 11:23:13,False,2,0,True,False,False,394,19,23929,2766,12849,2024-02-01 14:55:13

151454117,english,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU KNOW BALL AND LOVE BALL

The game does not reward knowing game mechanics, fundamentals of football, nor does it hold any kind of competitive integrity. The stats for the players do not affect the way the players play. Pace does not dictate how fast the players are, defending stats do not dictate how good a player defends at least in online play. What dictates the way the game works is the dynamic difficulty adjustments that are made by the game's engine in order to ""balance"" play. Being the top rank in the game is not about how well you play it and is more dependent on how much you play. Instead of matching players of equal skill level the game matches two players and turns the AI intelligence way up or way down for one of or both of the players.

It really sucks watching you favorite defenders jump out of the way of shots while you are jockeying to block, your favorite attackers slow down as soon as someone follows 3 meters behind them, and your favorite midfielders pass the ball directly to the feet of the opposition players when trying to get a through ball over just because the game engine decided that the 4'9"" defender can win the aerial battle versus 6'2"" striker.

The only reason the play the game is to play the single player modes and if you have any FIFA game after FIFA 12, you basically have this game, except in the other ones you can play the world cup.

If this game were to get rid of the DDA and were to introduce SBMM then it would be a good game, however that would require EA to be a community oriented game developer and that's not what they're about.",2023-11-24 02:15:49,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,4,3000,0,3000,2023-11-24 01:53:05

151390231,english,After reading all of the reviews I had to try this game out since it was on sale. I would like to say I have decided to refund the game which I will elaborate on after but I still recommend it. I primarily play career mode and kick off (normal games). Been playing FIfa games since I was little. I think there are MANY good additions to this game animation wise. I did not experience any of the tech issues other people were having and my system isnt anything super powerful. 6700 core gfx and i5-13500 cpu. The main issues I had with this game were two-fold. One being that the AI on defense is awful. I play on max difficulty settings with what I like to call (realistic) sliders for cpu and for me. Basically slowing the speed of the game down and making mistakes more common. I played a couple games trying different things but I tried Chelsea (my favorite team) vs Arsenal. I was able to score 9 goals against max difficulty AI with realism sliders. This is awful. The other issue I had was the midfield. The midfield feels non-existant. Most plays I made were just flying right through the midfield and the build up was none. Its just end to end. I hope in the next version of the game this improves. For most people this game is excellent and a great change compared to the past few games.,2023-11-23 19:41:40,True,2,0,True,False,False,0,14,377,306,70,2024-01-20 00:17:34

I haven't noticed anything negative that I haven't already experienced in FIFA 22 and FIFA 23.
This might not be helpful for anyone expecting a supremely developed next iteration of this franchise.
The good news is, there are a ton of new features, the game runs great on a (modern) PC and you can get it on sale (for a limited time).
I believe this new version, with all of its frustrating baggage, is well worth the sale price.
That's honest feedback without a single $%#ing curse word.

Even at the end of an era, FIFA 23 marks another year of careful attrition from EA, as several tactical and aesthetic revisions supplement its sturdy gameplay blueprint.

151142175,english,"Im usually a fifa nerd, playing since fifa 15. This genuinely is the worst ""fifa"" ive played ever. Ultimate team is a mess. Every game is a sweat fest with no skill gap and is so 1 dimensional that it gets incredibly repetitive and boring after 2 games. Rebounds are the worst they ever have been, mixed with OP finesse shots and running down the Bi-line to sweat across goal for an easy tap in. Everyone plays with the new 71 depth so the midfield is nonexistent most of the time. Attacking AI is absolute garbage. Playing fifa 17 again on xbox and you can see the massive difference in attacking AI and how they downgraded so hard over the last few years. In fifa 17, they actually MOVE and get into space. Wingers will actually make runs. This year, if you don't player lock, movement off the ball is virtually nonexistent. Content is garbage. EA have no idea how to balance promo teams. R1/RB dribbling far too broken. I could go on more but this should be enough lol. EA should fix the game before it dies more considering they are all about money. We will see if it improves. Save your money until something changes (if it every does)

Shockingly bad game-play that doesn't allow for any creativity or deviation from the 'meta'. It is genuinely impressive how bad this game-play is. Significantly worse that any other fifa I have ever played, including the very old fifa mobile games! 

The 'game' is particularly bad for PC, being poorly optimised and littered with bugs throughout the game - others have commented on this in detail.

It is clear that EA is entirely relying upon content which is only really there in such quantity to persuade consumers to buy their store packs tailored to give you the exact thing you need to complete their sbcs and objectives - which would otherwise being very difficult or outright impossible.

If you enjoy football and wish to play a game that resembles it and doesn't make you want to punch your screen in... this game is not for you.

If you buy the game for Ultimate Team... This game is actually not bad, the addition of Evolutions and PlayStyles make this game a lot more enjoyable. 

Evolutions can make low rated cards useful (even overpowered sometimes).

PlayStyles are like ""Traits"" form old FIFAs but WAY more interesting and useful, you can have up to 7 playStyles on a single ""normal"" card and one of them can be PlayStyle +. (Playstyle + are upgraded version of any playstyle)

The gameplay is........ meh.

Ryzen 5 5600
Zotac RTX 3060
16GB RAM Memmory

I run game like Diablo 4 at 120 fps solid, all maxed out. The PC is just 1 year old. When it comes to play FC24 and FIFA23... they have the same problems, stuttering and unable to run consistently. Graphic wise, EA has done nothing at all. More animations and crapy cutscenes. Most of the games have a good solid 30fps cutscenes at least. 

This game does not meat the expectations for a 70 euros price tag. I have bought on a sale and the game has not been fixed. When you buy a game with money you sweat to earn, tyou wonder why there's no other companies to take advantage of this dire situation we players are in.

It is a shame that a multi billion dollar company couldn't care less about its community, but also the approach this company has taken when it comes to this game. It is focus to kids that ddon't earn the money they pay the game with. Parents pay it and that gives EA a reason to do nothing and re-skin FIFA23. You put both games against and you see no difference at all.

No patches solve the stuttering in FIFA 23, so it won't for FC24, just a straight fact. Wish the community would rally against  EA and sue the hell out of them. At this point i am desperate for a revolutionary shift in the industry, and iam willing to support any company that wants to deliver for the community. EA is nothing without it.

150953387,english,"Poorly optimised for PC. I would recommend playing this game only after a massive update for bug fixes and feature implementation for some of the things I've mentioned below.

1 - Lagging, freezing or stuttering after each and every corner kick for a few seconds (which are very important in a game in which you are down 1 goal in min 87 for example). 
That stupid 2 seconds lag/stutter after executing a corner kick is heartbreaking, I mean, why would you do this? 

2 - Another annoying bug (feature for EA) is in Career Mode - Manager. 
If you exceed expectations on every objective, aside from the least important one, the relationship between you and the board worsens by each day, until when you click Finish Season, you are at half (or below). I exceeded ALL important, crucial objectives, but for the low one, I didn't raise the average age level of the team to 28, therefore I on thin line to get fired, or eventually get fired (even after winning an European competition, the title and the cup, and making over 50 mil in profit). 

3 - Not mentioning the fact that I DON'T HAVE THE TEAM LINEUP PRESENTATION anymore! This is a BIG minus from my side.
I always liked to look at the team I've built, the team I'm up against, the table/position I'm in etc. Taking this out and substituting it with idiotic drum beating or people screaming on the street is enraging. In Champions League the whole atmosphere was give by that presentation, hymn and everything. 

I'm sure I've encountered many more annoying ""features"" but I can't remember them right now.

150865771,english,"I Played Ea 24 on a Switch for months. Now, I have decided to upgrade my experience and this is def a better, smoother gameplay. On Switch the players seem like they are playing Hockey so far on this version, I  have not gone through it which is truly amazing. 

There are of course some things I do not like, such as intro cutscenes, they were for the most part, removed, I honestly would have loved watching them specially now, we higher resolution. Additionally, some cutscenes seem to have bugs, for instance every time a cutscene begins, it lags and then plays normally. It is kinda annoying I am not gonna lie. 

I wish they could fix cutscenes lagging and add the rest of the truly amazing cutscenes this game has (Basing this on my Switch experience) I will without a shadow of a doubt play this game for hours. Best advice, do not get it  on a low end computer because the game seems to run very awful on those type of PCs. Also, if you are using a controller go to settings to change game style Keyboard+Mouse to simply Keyboard. This will allow you to use your controller for essentially everything, some times the game forces you to use the mouse to scroll through some menu options. 

Additionally, this game is not worth full price, wait for a special deal such as 50% off or higher. The game is way better optimized for next gen consoles so do not expect a perfect or sleek game, and yes, you will encounter issues with high end computers. PS: I do not play Ultimate team so I do not have anything to say about online gaming to my understanding you have to lower the graphics to play it descently. 

Overall I give this game a 7 out of 10. I got it on a special deal so it was worth the money I spent on it. And lastly do not fall under the trap the more FPS the better, nope, this is a sport simulator that runs better on a locked refresh rate of  60 frames per second.

Refeering feels 50-50 everytime they added a system where u can change the leaniancy and it feels so unfair and inconsistent on UT

Feels so slow and sluggish in general.

Awful UI. Just poor in design and looks awful. When cycle to ur tasks/acheivements in UT u dont have a red dot over the sections u have awards to redeem u have to manually scroll through it. 

Crashes and lags alot. Getting huge frame drops and lag spikes if i accidently alt tab and my games runs behind 

Long wait times and just a horrible frustrating experience. not worth any money at all

Played 10 more hours. Id rather fall down the stairs for 50 hours instead of playing this game other than proclubs.

150503854,english,"Story Short: game is very bad, because EA is greedy. I play it only when I can't sleep, because it resets my mind.

Story Long: FC 24 and all previous Fifas should be used on economy classes as perfect example of what monopoly does to the product. I don't even know where to start while saying what is bad with this game, but I'll try.

It's not for casuals. Really. You either need to spend a lot of $ or a lot of time to have any chance while playing with others. After my about 60 hours I don't even have class C semi under meta single player. I know - you can say, 60h in 3 months ? only ? For Fifa players 60h is like nothing. 

The other thing is matchmaking. Matchmaking not based on skill-ELO rating should be legally banned. It causes frustration. In one division I am winning (almost) every match. I feel the frustrations of opponents. Pausing all times. Sending me friend requests after match they lost 0:8 only to relieve their pain by insulting me, and my ancestors 20 generations earlier. Then.... I advance to next division and I loose 30 matches in a row having no chance with much better players. And there's no relegation :) So I need to on purpose forfeit matches only to stay in lower divisions. Sorry, I don't have 10000h in life to learn all the skill moves to compete with people who play it 1000000 hours every year. I just want to play even matches with people on my average level. I want to have 3:3 in match. Not 8:0 or 0:8. Game is supposed to be fun. Losing 30 matches or winning 30 matches in a row is not fun. It's either frustrating or boring. That's why all competitive games in the world implement ELO. But EA does not have to - it has monopoly, people will play it anyway because of love to the football.

Btw. it's no surprise how EA works if it's CEO for years was the same guy who destroyed Unity.

Re evolutions which meant to be for casuals to upgrade mediocre players to decent level. How cool is that ? No, really not so cool. Requirements to upgrade my Grosicki to 83 is to win 50 matches in 14 days. You need to basically half time work 20h weekly to complete a single quest.

Another thing is the price: every year Fifa is one of the most expensive games on Steam.... and still it has micro transactions. You pay for the game and then you need to either invest a lot of money or crazy amount of time to be able to actually play it - otherwise meta teams will just crash you. Seriously ?

I will still play it, because I love football. But it's just crazy that there's no competition and EA may do whatever. Monopoly.",2023-11-20 19:07:02,False,0,0,True,False,False,165,23,5051,0,3285,2024-01-04 00:35:49

150436882,english,"[h3]Background[/h3]

I [b]have prior experience[/b] playing and enjoying football simulators, and this isn't my first encounter with the genre or the specific franchise. As a football enthusiast, my expectations were quite low, especially after reading some reviews. Nevertheless, I approached the game with interest and hope for a positive surprise. However, I [b]cannot recommend this game[/b] unless you fall into a very specific group of people, which I will elaborate on in this review.

Let's delve into the three most prominent game modes, which essentially encompass about 99% of the game's content.

[h3]Ultimate Team[/h3]

If you've ever witnessed people playing slots in Las Vegas, this mode might evoke similar feelings of shame and disgust. It's advisable to reconsider and [b]seek help[/b] if you find yourself going down this path.

[h3]Career Mode[/h3]

This mode should constitute the majority of your gameplay if you lean towards a power trip style of play. Progress, change leagues, build a team, win titles, and more. You even have the flexibility to adjust sliders and difficulty for a challenging experience against the computer.

[h3]Clubs[/h3]

On paper, this mode appears highly promising. You can choose a role, team up with friends, play together, lead your team to higher leagues, claim trophies, enhance your character, customize appearance and skills to match your gameplay, and compete against other teams. Sounds super fun, right? Well, here's the catch...

[h3]The Catch - Main Thesis[/h3]

The game is [b]evidently flawed[/b]. While it claims to be a football simulator, it's more of an [b]exploit simulator[/b]. If you don't conform to the prevailing trends in team composition and player abilities, centered around what is exploitable, you'll find yourself unable to compete against those who do. YOU WILL LOSE. Learning and executing exploits becomes a necessity, and while there are numerous tutorial videos available, succumbing to this approach can ruin the overall gaming experience.

Allow me to provide some examples that resonate with around 90% of the player base. The game's current form, and as per discussions with other players, past and possibly future iterations, is highly exploitable. Consequently, you'll witness only three types of goals in this so-called football simulator.

1 - Players exploiting the sides of the pitch, executing either a cross (Beckham's to Ronaldo vs Zaragoza) or a series of cheap passes systematically positioned between your defenders.

2 - A finesse/trivela kick from the corner of the box (Quaresma style), always resulting in a goal due to a bug in goalkeeper positioning.

3 - A messy first-post header from a corner, forcing you to move the goalkeeper around the box while the opponent reverts to the aforementioned alternatives.

While you may score and witness hundreds of goals like these, the game's rigidity to these play styles and game-breaking mechanics eradicates the sense of being immersed in a football simulator. It feels more like a game of [b]""exploit or perish.""[/b]

[h3]To wrap it up[/h3]

Frankly, I anticipated much more from the purported best-in-industry and expensive game. This disappointment isn't solely based on the gameplay; it extends to actual bugs involving matchmaking, glitched menus, automatic configuration reverting, uniform malfunctions, a community rife with sore losers resorting to excessive sliding tackles and leaving matches when behind, glitched animations, inexplicable computer decisions, alleged handicapping of matches, and other issues that my friends and I endured to play this game.

In summary, and being entirely candid, I [b]strongly advise against[/b] subjecting yourself to this experience.

[h3]That being said...[/h3]

... there's one exception though: if you happen to be a die-hard fan of the franchise for decades, maintaining a close-knit group of friends who play it year after year, regardless of the game's price or condition. If that's the case, go ahead; perhaps the camaraderie with your friends will provide moments of laughter, temporarily diverting your attention from the overall mess that this game truly is.",2023-11-19 17:07:28,False,170,4,True,False,False,0,3,11456,89,8361,2024-01-29 00:23:37

Gameplay's gone down the drain, and FC24 is the bottom of the barrel. It's slow, frustrating, and it's killing the joy of playing. As a die-hard fan, it's just sad seeing the game I loved turn into this.

Even with my setup – RTX 3070, 16GB RAM, i5 13k – FC24 on PC is a disaster. Other games run smooth as butter, but not this one. Bugs and stutters ruin the experience, and it's not my rig's fault.

I stick to Seasons, given how messed up Ultimate Team is. But even there, FC24 can't get its act together. Freezes and sudden 2x speed bursts wreck the game. I've lost count of how many times this crap cost me goals.

Paying full price for this? It's a joke. FC24 falls short on every front. I hope EA fixes this mess, but my optimism is shot. This year's a write-off.

150339789,english,"Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life, our existence must entirely fail of its aim. It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule.

I know of no greater absurdity than that propounded by most systems of philosophy in declaring evil to be negative in its character. Evil is just what is positive; it makes its own existence felt. Leibnitz is particularly concerned to defend this absurdity; and he seeks to strengthen his position by using a palpable and paltry sophism. It is the good which is negative; in other words, happiness and satisfaction always imply some desire fulfilled, some state of pain brought to an end.

This explains the fact that we generally find pleasure to be not nearly so pleasant as we expected, and pain very much more painful.

The pleasure in this world, it has been said, outweighs the pain; or, at any rate, there is an even balance between the two. If the reader wishes to see shortly whether this statement is true, let him compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other.

The best consolation in misfortune or affliction of any kind will be the thought of other people who are in a still worse plight than yourself; and this is a form of consolation open to every one. But what an awful fate this means for mankind as a whole!

We are like lambs in a field, disporting themselves under the eye of the butcher, who chooses out first one and then another for his prey. So it is that in our good days we are all unconscious of the evil Fate may have presently in store for us – sickness, poverty, mutilation, loss of sight or reason.

No little part of the torment of existence lies in this, that Time is continually pressing upon us, never letting us take breath, but always coming after us, like a taskmaster with a whip. If at any moment Time stays his hand, it is only when we are delivered over to the misery of boredom.

But misfortune has its uses; for, as our bodily frame would burst asunder if the pressure of the atmosphere was removed, so, if the lives of men were relieved of all need, hardship and adversity; if everything they took in hand were successful, they would be so swollen with arrogance that, though they might not burst, they would present the spectacle of unbridled folly—nay, they would go mad. And I may say, further, that a certain amount of care or pain or trouble is necessary for every man at all times. A ship without ballast is unstable and will not go straight.

Certain it is that work, worry, labor and trouble, form the lot of almost all men their whole life long. But if all wishes were fulfilled as soon as they arose, how would men occupy their lives? what would they do with their time? If the world were a paradise of luxury and ease, a land flowing with milk and honey, where every Jack obtained his Jill at once and without any difficulty, men would either die of boredom or hang themselves; or there would be wars, massacres, and murders; so that in the end mankind would inflict more suffering on itself than it has now to accept at the hands of Nature.

In early youth, as we contemplate our coming life, we are like children in a theatre before the curtain is raised, sitting there in high spirits and eagerly waiting for the play to begin. It is a blessing that we do not know what is really going to happen. Could we foresee it, there are times when children might seem like innocent prisoners, condemned, not to death, but to life, and as yet all unconscious of what their sentence means. Nevertheless, every man desires to reach old age; in other words, a state of life of which it may be said: “It is bad to-day, and it will be worse to-morrow; and so on till the worst of all.”

If you try to imagine, as nearly as you can, what an amount of misery, pain and suffering of every kind the sun shines upon in its course, you will admit that it would be much better if, on the earth as little as on the moon, the sun were able to call forth the phenomena of life; and if, here as there, the surface were still in a crystalline state.

Again, you may look upon life as an unprofitable episode, disturbing the blessed calm of non-existence. And, in any case, even though things have gone with you tolerably well, the longer you live the more clearly you will feel that, on the whole, life is a disappointment, nay, a cheat.

If two men who were friends in their youth meet again when they are old, after being separated for a life-time, the chief feeling they will have at the sight of each other will be one of complete disappointment at life as a whole; because their thoughts will be carried back to that earlier time when life seemed so fair as it lay spread out before them in the rosy light of dawn, promised so much – and then performed so little. This feeling will so completely predominate over every other that they will not even consider it necessary to give it words; but on either side it will be silently assumed, and form the ground-work of all they have to talk about.

He who lives to see two or three generations is like a man who sits some time in the conjurer’s booth at a fair, and witnesses the performance twice or thrice in succession. The tricks were meant to be seen only once; and when they are no longer a novelty and cease to deceive, their effect is gone.

While no man is much to be envied for his lot, there are countless numbers whose fate is to be deplored.

... random game freezes with graphic objects missing; really bad optimization with graphics tech that are teh root of catastrophic game freezes

...UT - is nothing short of a shell game. 
Missing packs from completing SBC challenges - you should get a pack as indicated, and them nothing... and all that hard earned card collateral gone in an instance, trapped in EA support nightmare which is designed to deter you. The game is a con on those terms alone. 

... I encourage any lawyer to look into gaming practices, rates of failure, and the games being played with the economies herein.  The sheer quantity of duplicates is paramount to discussion and in over 40 years of trading real cards - baseball, soccer, and more... never would the amount of duplicates pollute so prevalent; and the effort manage duplicates in anyway to make use of them is nothing short of a con.   Even CS:GO economics doesn't get as egregious and underhanded as EA in UT

...nothing has really change in the years of playing this with UT, yet gov'ts around the world allow this company to literally fleece kids and adults alike with no oversight or regulation to these ""economies "" that launder real money to EA, and slight patrons with nothing more than useless pictures and no value in game.

Massive harsh to my mellow.   I used to think it was EA that booted FIFA, but it was FIFA that booted EA because their business practices, and attention to quality are non-existent.  There development scrum is the worst I have heard about in programming circles.... and their PO is not competent enough to ensure quality doesn't suffer while doing the bidding for a leadership that has no real interest in gaming. 

So many things that could be better if there was someone who cared about quality...  Lately DualSense support on PC completely disappeared overnight; upon reinstall the entire game would no longer launch; as usual the EA client flakes out (but at least no destroying the system like in the 2000s...   and of course it take an undo amount of time and effort to cleanup the trash and get the game to working order, because EA cant do it for themselves. 
--  That issue was exasperated by ""server maintenance"" and killed a seasonal opportunity to finish my evolution player base, and literally cost me money... I'm not pretending that I'll ever receive an apology or reconciliation either.   


So why do I play it? 

I came back after a 15 year hiatus of playing this title...  I gave it a full rogering over the past few yeas (2022, 2023, and FC 24 titles = 3000 hours +) - for three years, biting my tongue along the way...  sharpening some average skilled to participate in the game, in full, as it is today.  

-Clubs and Volta have great potential, but the ques suffer and game rules of engagement need to be tightened up

-career modes had been improved but can also fall flat in some areas as they are incomplete... Seasons, Tourney's and more...   

...all around the technical of actual game play have been excellent; better than ever in fact...  yet FC 24 needs desperate tuning of animations and game play. Penalties are a joke and most fouls in WC and above are ridiculously out of sync with animations in game play.  .

For all the opinions about game play - The game is really only spoiled with greed and sloppy development cycles.   I'd spare the details (a 25 page bug log I will be submitting, many that have transcended the past three years of titles)  here, only to offered the above that if you want to fully participate completely in this game, it will cost you far more that the initial price you pay - and completely skewed to greed, you will waste money as I have, just even to stay somewhat competitive - at the lowest levels of success for on line competitive play in UT.  The Average majority of players will never reap the full offering and benefits of the game and have been completely conned by EA otherwise to thinking that is a suitable consolation.

9/10 will never realize the full value of what they pay for and it is a rip off top to bottom considering the quality issues and unforeseen traps present in their ""economy"" (read: shell game).",2023-11-18 03:45:49,False,1,0,True,False,False,0,12,47997,40,26113,2024-01-29 21:03:13

things new with FC 24 as follows:

A playstyle mechanic that determines what does a player do good or bad, a player with 40 defending with raccoon+ playstyle is a better defender than a player with 99 defending without it, 

Goalkeepers that never played a single game in their life: Every shot on target will end up in a deflection and will be scored, if it was possible it'd be better to play with and extra defender rather than having a keeper in this game

Sounds that you cant turn off: Before games team anthems are always on 100% volume so even if you put the ingame setting for musics to 0 and general sound to 1% it'll damage your ears with garbage music

Rubberbanding, this year with potato servers helping, you will have players on the ground after a tackle taking powershots before getting up, you will have players run through others like a ghost, you will have your keeper release a ball that they've saved, get up and tried to dive for it again only to make the ball go behind them for an open goal",2023-11-17 14:25:43,False,4,0,False,False,False,0,18,15450,695,4655,2024-01-30 21:13:27

The game runs smoothly for the first 60 minutes, but after that point, it becomes virtually unplayable. Despite tweaking graphics settings and lowering the resolution to the lowest possible, I still encounter persistent lagging and freezing, making it impossible to fully enjoy the gameplay.

I invested 7 hours into the game, hoping the issues would resolve, but to no avail. The lack of optimization is evident, and it significantly impacts the overall experience. It's disheartening to see a game with such potential fall short in delivering a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

I understand that not all games can be flawless, but the extent of the performance issues in EA FC 24 goes beyond what can be considered acceptable. It's disappointing to spend time and money on a game only to encounter such frustrating technical problems.

I sincerely hope that the developers address these issues with future updates, as I believe the game has the potential to be great if the performance is optimized properly.

149775184,english,"To start: i don't recommend the game. It's riddled with bugs not only in the gameplay, but there's a lot of visual bugs in the UI. The UI also makes no sense and is just a clutter. 

Microtransactions are back in full force, and EA are shoving out untradeable packs in the shop. Not only do they want to sell you digital goods that are worthless in a year, but they also want to sell you digital goods that might be useless immediately as you pack them. 

Ultimate team gets most of EAs little attention and the other game modes are usually left in the dust. The only positive part about this iteration is improvements to pro clubs and a few for player career. Bugs takes way too long to fix.

The gameplay feels sluggish and non responsive. While this matter is highy subjective, it is in my opinion the worst FIFA/EAFC ever made regarding gameplay. 

Conclusion: 
The game is really bad, and EA keeps pushing the microtransactions they make billions off with barely any of the money going back in to the game to make it better. The game is riddled with bugs and it takes forever to fix them, if they ever get fixed at all. It just screams lazy, and it's unacceptable that a multi billionaire company such as EA can churn out this garbage with no effort each year.",2023-11-08 20:58:11,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,2,5869,0,5531,2024-01-05 03:03:37

This game is a freaking joke and EA's content team is the only thing keeping this game above water at the moment. If it were up to the useless game developers that code the actual gameplay, this game would've been exposed for an absolute scam already.

Here is a couple of reasons why NOT to buy this game:
- There is A LOT of button delay when playing online. Passes will often take off a full 1.5-2 seconds after you've given the button imput.
- There is a clear and obvious cheating problem that, even after 5 YEARS of me playing this game on this platform, still has not been addressed.
- The unfixable frame drops that affect like 30% of players, including me of course.
- The no-loss glitching that yeets you out of already won games, after which it gives you 'Oh we don't know what happened' message and gives you either the loss or a game that counted towards EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR PLAYERS AND OBJECTIVES but of course DIDN'T towards any rewards.
- It is complete RNG whether or not you'll win an online match. It's almost as if the servers actively try to give you or your opponent an edge through 'passing errors' that the AI make.

149496734,english,"I've been playing football games and Fifa since 90's.

This is the absolutely worst football game by EA.
This years FC24 edition seems different from previous ones because of one noticeable issue. Gameplay is decent but performed actions, passes, shots, tackles etc seem to be much more clunky than before. Also the DDA seems to kick in way harder. I feel really bad scoring 2-0 in very early match, it feels like it's always going to end something like 3-6 when DDA gives the boost for opponent. Yep, my tin foil hat is on.

I believe ""clunkiness"" is part of DDA and game constantly determines, for example, wether a pass should be delivered to own player or to opponent. This causes unsatisfying interceptions and also ""wow I didn't actually try and/or deserve this""-feeling when sometimes DDA kicks in for me and unbelievable pass completes. Game this year is lacking the satisfying feeling that you've played well or built a good attack. Don't really need to meantion winger+cutback methods...

Is there DDA in competitive multiplayer matches and why would EA make it so?

- Money. More even the matches are, winning or losing, more money people spend on average. Equal matches make people keep playing and want to improve their teams. Huge losses cause players to quit the game and they are worth 0$ to EA. This is nothing new, online gaming has even patented ways to make online matches artificially even and giving players feeling that they should spend money.

In corporate point of view, it would be very stupid to not optimize matches as equal as possible, giving players good feelings and incentive to spend money to FC Points. No board of directors in company this big will ever say ""it's ok let players play fair and let's take whatever they want to spend"". No way. Any such director would be fired on spot. They optimize the player experience if they are even remotely smart.

In players point of view, this of course is very disrespectful and scummy behaviour.

So why this year passes and gameplay feels unsatisfying and clunky? I believe it's the same reason as poor quality of menus, bugs and UI crap. They are doing the minimum they can get away with. Same logic goes to gameplay and DDA especially. Of course it would be possible to use DDA so discreetly or smoothly that players don't notice it, but it would take way much more work, causing metric tons of expenses. Not really what EA does in other fronts, they want to spend the minimum.

Solution? Maybe call them out for DDA. Ask for fair matches. Ask for fair pricing models. Vote for loot box bans in your countries. Any other ideas? Share them in comments!

Ps. I don't care how many wins I get in WL. I just want fair matches, even endin 0-0 or 0-1. I want decent quality product and fair monitization. I want to be relegated in divisions, finding my own skill level and working my skills from there.",2023-11-04 08:26:25,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,4,9067,422,7054,2024-01-31 22:31:51

-If you/anyone abandons a match there is NO punishment and if its a tie game, you dont get the win
-Not beginner friendly
-why is there no Level/Skill system to differentiate the sweaty players from the new players
some objectives REQUIRE you to win 10 matches against random opponent and there is a 80% chance that player will be a veteran or sweaty player
-This game gets the anger out of anyone when playing online. 
-Attacking and defending needs a Master´s degree.
-this games is not worth 70 bucks
-everything feels clunky and the characters feel like they are on ice when having the ball
-lots of bugs and issues

PROS:
-lots of missions and packs (good rewards)
-each play takes 6-10 minutes
-fun when playing with a friend

Yes, there was still lag from time to time but when playing with MAX graph, not with MIN as now.
I'm starting to think that EA posted false system requirements to scam people to buy their game or the only thing they do to the game is make it worse with every next patch and update.
There are good things though - the player's motion is great and more realistic than ever. Mechanics-wise the game is the greatest Fifa so far. Totally love the way the players interact and act as a whole.

149350752,english,"The game outside of UT is perfectly fine, besides the changes made to the training grounds.
Ultimate Team is now even more P2W than it has been any other year. From the very start the big big packs that we wouldn't see till Toty are out in week 1. The meta from Fifa23 carried over making the first few weeks basically unplayable for those that just chill and play for fun. After that it changed to 71 depth, 424/442/4231/442(2)/4222, with pressure after possession lost. This still has not been changed even after 5 or so weeks. The new Evolutions are a great concept but have been poorly executed. Within the first batch of Evos they made 78 Ansu Fati into an 84/85 that was a very cheap replacement for Mbappe with better links. Since then the evolutions have been not so game breaking until this last one where you can make Llorente even better. The DDA still rules supreme and sways matches away from the actually good to cater towards those that are worse. In previous years it was noticeable but not all that drastic to where a game would be decided on who had DDA in their favor. Not in EAFC24 though. In 24 the DDA decides matches unless you can somehow just be that much better. The best players will feel so much worse when DDA kicks in. Mbappe will feel like 78 pace, VVD will feel like a bronze, Courtious would be better replaced with the 1 arm woman. DDA is that bad in UT.

Update from 12/5/23:
Evo's have slowed down on being meta and broken and now are just replacements for recently released cards. The meta has not changed since the first week. Well that isnt true, it has gotten a lot worse in terms of play meta or loose the game. 4231-442-424-4321-4213-433(4) are now the most used with the center of the pitch being either overly congested to the point the attacking side can not play through it. At the same time the wingers, forward, and fullbacks will press anyone on the line making it so the best you can do is pass around the back, long balls over the top, or switching the full field. 4231 is the most commonly used formation since you not only have 8/10 players in the middle but also the LCAM and RCAM will occasionally push out to pressure on the line, the 2 CDM basically act as 2 CB and are most commonly the only players most will use to defend besides an occasional fullback. DDA is worse than ever, even worse than when I first wrote this review. You can be winning 4-0 in the 75th minute and tie 4-4 or lose 4-5 or 4-6 because DDA kicked in. Finesse shot and + are broken and the thing most based their attackers off of.
Luckily with what I have read from the new patch notes for the Holiday Update, the congesting the middle will now not be a viable meta, and finesse shot and + will have its accuracy reduced.

Update From 12/26/23
This is very close to the last update I did on my review but with a new patch and tons more new promos it felt like a good time to post an update.
After the Holiday Patch EA said that they fixed the congested midfield, pressure on the touch line, Finesse Shot and Shot+, and 3 back LM/RM. Congested midfield is true, it isn't as bad as it was but Pros have figured out tactics to counter the patch and share it with the public. This luckily is still very open in the middle. Pressure on the touch line isn't as heavy unless against a 5 back or 424. Finesse shot and + do not seem like that took any hit by the recent patch, they are still broken and now players are seeing this and deciding to hit it from 30+ yards out. Power headers were hit too hard, now the accuracy is terrible to the point itd be better to just play a corner short. 3 backs are now almost completely useless and back to the way they used to be. So all in all EA did a good patch that has mostly made the game tolerable again and semi-playable. DDA still runs all games and decides who wins and looses before kick off. If EA were to actually read reviews and see this all I'd ask is to fix DDA in UT and don't make it a thing. It is holding good players hostage in lower divisions because it is making their players hard to play with and letting the opposition win. When in reality it shouldn't be there and players should be able to climb back up tho their real ranks so that the lower ranks are for the actually bad players.",2023-11-02 04:53:45,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,4,32900,3158,13299,2024-02-01 04:36:27

Not only lag, it sometimes kicks you from the game and you are losing, even you are beating shit out of your opponent. For exp. I was playing draft with my awesome team, I won 3 match and last game I was winning like 3-0.

2. The DDA/ scripting seems to be getting out of hand this year, some games your players are good and the next they feel like bronze players.
3. The gameplay is very poor, feels like the engine isnt optimized properly - the ball keeps on bouncing back to opponent after tackling,

[h1]  FIFA 24 Falls Short of Its Predecessor [/h1]

[b]Having played FIFA 24 since its release, it's becoming increasingly challenging to maintain my enthusiasm for the game. Numerous gameplay issues and menu glitches make it hard to ignore the stark contrast between this year's installment and the previous one. [/b]

[h2]The Inclusion of Women in Ultimate Team[/h2]
[b]The decision to incorporate female football players into Ultimate Team, competing alongside their male counterparts, raises legitimate concerns. It's not about being misogynistic; it's about the game's realism. It's hard to believe that a female football player can outmuscle or outjump a defensive powerhouse like Van Dijk. A more acceptable approach might have been to create a separate women's section within the game, allowing players to engage in challenges for unique rewards. [/b]

[h2]Evolutions[/h2]
[b]One of the redeeming features of FIFA 24 is its evolution aspect. However, it's disappointing to see some cards being sold at exorbitant prices despite being well behind the meta curve. This can be frustrating for players who want to remain competitive. [/b]

[h2]Packs and Microtransactions[/h2]
[b]The issue of packs and microtransactions is spiraling out of control. In the past, players eagerly anticipated new SBCs, but now it seems that EA is bombarding us with 2000 or 3000 FIFA points packs, each costing a steep $30 to $40. This aggressive approach to monetization overshadows the gaming experience. [/b]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
[b]It's disheartening to observe that FIFA 24 falls short of the enjoyment I derived from its predecessor. It appears that EA's priorities have shifted more towards maximizing profits than ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience for its customers. As a player who thoroughly enjoyed FIFA in the past, it's disheartening to witness this shift in priorities. [/b]

But days went by without contact from Gronk and i realized by getting him to rizz up Livy Dunne I pulled him far away from me and i had lost my best buddy. Years went by and I gained depression and was drinking more often until... One day on rizzbook i saw the news that filled me up with light and hope "" BABY GRONK HAS BROKEN UP WITH LIVY DUNNE!"" I stumbled to my phone and called Baby Gronk and he was happy to hear from me and being honest tears were shed during the call. Now in present day Im happy and Best Buddys again with Baby Gronk he admits to making the biggest mistake in his life but it doesnt matter anymore to me im happy now and i will be forever more with my level 9 gyatt in Ohio with Baby Gronk with NO MORE RIZZING UP LIVY DUNE.

149042222,english,"Purchased the game strictly to play Pro Clubs and while I'm aware I haven't mastered all the (new) mechanics of the game (since my last FIFA was FIFA 14)... the game is absolutely horrific.
Riddled with bugs, extremely clunky and incredibly infuriating in certain scenarios.
There's pro's and con's to this game...but it as of right now (28/10/2023) it feels like an alpha title...not even a beta release.
---
There is a new ""training"" feature in pro clubs - allowing you to get up to 4000XP every week. Sounds great right? Except, once you complete the training session - the UI bugs out and the only way out of it is to force shut down the game and re-launch. 10/10.
---
The passing has all gone to crap. Forget about through balls in 90% of the situations. AI's also don't know how to through ball with majority of the balls getting intercepted by the opponent's AI.
You used to be able to use skill moves to get past AI opponents - not anymore. The guy will cover and jockey you the entire time until you take a slightly heavier touch and lose possession. The only time skill moves work on AI's is when they bug out and miss a tackle.
Set pieces (Free kicks, corners) are absolutely horrendous. The good old days when you had to use pure intuition and skill to score? Gone. Replaced with an awful ""guided aim"" where you have to select your curve and direction. 2.9 of a bar? Well - sorry champ, the ball drops down to knee level of the keeper. 3.0 and above? Oh, well good luck saving it!
---
The balancing between tackling and issuing commands to AI is passable at best. When you're instructing the AI to clear the ball (Press B or O), half the time you end up tackling the air yourself - and if you're unfortunate enough you give away penalties or free kicks. Outstanding!
---
As for the experience with online players? Funnily enough it's greatly improved since I last played a FIFA title - with the exception of a few, my experience has been as an overall positive.
I prefer the new system where you have to invest points in your skills (shot power, passing etc.) - but with the passing so bad, I found that there's little to no point investing your points in that skill tree.
---
There's potential for this game, but the rate at which bugs are fixed and patches are released right now is anything but Agile DevOps. I feel like this game was left with a skeleton crew to support the release and moved on the the ""EA FC 25"" title; where majority of bugs are still probably going to prevail and they'll sell you a new ground-breaking feature that nobody uses and everyone skips through.

149004403,english,"Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the [b] most horrific title ever released. [/b] This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

[h3] Player Flexibility: [/h3]
With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!). 

[h3] Player Movement: [/h3]
Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

[h3] Predatory Marketing: [/h3]
For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players).

148951467,english,"Hey, I'm a pretty casual FIFA, or I guess now its FC24 but a very casual player none the less. The FIFA I've been playing for a long time now was FIFA17, great game, still play it a bunch. I thought to myself, it's been 6 years, might as well try a new one. So i picked up this. There are some new features I didn't have in 17 so I had some fun messing around with the newer features and everything like that. been playing for about 24 hours as of writing this. And I can confidently say I'm having a good time! yeah sometimes it makes me want to throw my controller in an active volcano, but that's just FIFA. There are bugs here and there still, but most of them aren't really game changing and I've mainly laughed when I've gotten them since most of them in my experience are just silly glitches. Some thoughts though if you want a pros and cons list:

Pros:
-Some new shit was added, hooray
-New soundtrack is pretty awesome, I enjoy FIFA17s more though
-Okay career mode, I do miss the actual career with the VA and stuff though

Cons:
-Some bugs here and there, not that big of a deal though
-Ai can be pretty goofy sometimes, can get annoying

Final Thoughts:
Hey, listen, if you haven't picked up a new game in a while, give this one a try, you can always refund it! (Just make sure you haven't played for over 2 hours unless a really nice steam employee gives mercy upon your soul) I haven't ventured to online yet, so I'd look to other reviewers for that. All in all, I like the game from a casual perspective. Hope this helps and have a good day!",2023-10-27 04:40:23,True,0,0,True,False,False,160,24,2226,113,1387,2024-01-20 22:32:54

148889632,english,"""EA Sports FC 24"" truly sets a new standard when it comes to graphics and presentation in the world of football gaming. The visual elements are incredibly impressive, and they manage to create an unparalleled sense of realism and immersion. You genuinely feel like you're part of a real football league, thanks to the meticulous attention to detail in player animations and stadium design.

However, speaking from a personal standpoint, the gameplay can be a bit of a mixed bag. The momentum/scripting system, while intriguing, sometimes feels capricious. It can be challenging to anticipate outcomes, and that unpredictability can occasionally be a source of frustration because you suddenly lose control of your player.

For example, in a match, if one team is significantly better than the other, the scripting mechanic may come into play to level the playing field. This could lead to the underdog team suddenly performing exceptionally well, while the stronger team might experience a dip in performance. In essence, it's an attempt to make games more exciting and less one-sided.

In conclusion, ""EA Sports FC 24"" offers an awe-inspiring visual experience for football enthusiasts. The game's attention to detail is truly commendable. On the flip side, the gameplay has not changed much from the last decade, particularly the impact of the momentum system, can be a bit perplexing at times, making the overall experience a bit of a rollercoaster.",2023-10-26 06:35:53,False,2,0,True,False,False,0,7,18,0,6,2023-11-21 22:55:00

They're faster with the ball even though my pace is 90+ and theirs is 80. I don't know if the matchmaking is just trash because I get beaten by 10+ goals most games when I was winning almost every game before scoring 5+ goals a game.

148751718,english,"I bought this game last week and I'm almost 20 hours in. I'm in a bit of a unique situation as a *very* casual FIFA player. For context, I only recently started getting back into the sport as a spectator after a spell of not caring at all about sports, and as such I decided to buy EAFC 24 so I can play the game in the modern day. For context, the last and only FIFA game I ever had was FIFA 15, so almost 10 years between the editions I bought.

I'm also not your usual FIFA player in that I could not care less about UT. Sure, I'll open it every once in a while, do some objectives, open the reward pack/s and call it a day. But I'm not interested in the competitive play because I'm too ass at the game. If I were to load up a friendly right now I'd get stomped by someone who's played every FIFA since they were born and already has a team of icons and heroes and trailblazers. So, I only play manager and player modes. Mostly player mode, actually. Right now I'm about 4 months into my first year at Reading, with the intention of making the jump to the PL and becoming the world's best CF/CAM in existence. 

Of course, this game is buggy. Even as a casual player, I see the bugs that this game has. It's just classic FIFA. I've already seen player models inside each other, incompetent goalkeeping, strange crowd chants for teams that aren't playing, crashes, player images not loading in UT cards, etc. I came into this game expecting this. The bar was low. But, it's been enjoyable. I've been having fun. Player career mode has been particularly fun. I've been on Legendary difficulty and am still able to perform well as an individual. It's not egregiously difficult where I can't score goals or dribble past defenders or make passes, but it's also not insanely easy where I score 4 goals every match and just farm the league. The one thing I really don't like is how the manager favor immediately decides your eligibility for starting 11. I dropped a stinker one game and my manager's favor dropped so much that I was a sub for the next three games despite me being a scoring machine, which doesn't make sense. If Haaland drops a stinker every once in a while and Pep decides to bench him for a month that'd be horrible. But I digress. And no, I don't restart games. I'm not a cheater. If my team loses, then my team loses. If I drop a stinker, then I drop a stinker.

Also, I hate to be that guy, but anyone that's been complaining about the game not running correctly has either never opened the options menu or has a really shit computer. I have a gaming laptop, so it's not a potato, but it's also not a full battlestation. The game runs fine at medium settings, hovering around 120 fps. The few times I've played online on FUT have been great and lag-less, which was something I remember very much struggling with on FIFA 15 when I had it.

If you're like me and only buy a FIFA once every few years, I would recommend this game. It has its charm and offers enough to keep you entertained, especially if you don't do UT either. Just make sure to lower your expectations. It's still EA and it's still FIFA. It's not at all perfect. But, it's fun, and that's what matters to me.",2023-10-23 21:54:12,True,98,0,True,False,False,88,9,2293,0,1082,2023-12-02 23:54:20

148653869,english,"TL;DR Online modes are rinse-and-repeat of previous installations. Too many bugs/recycles that cause soft locks or diminish overall experience during career mode. Most of the new mechanics are either inconsequential or contribute to the issues plaguing career modes...
.
.
First things first, the parts of this game that function are nothing too special. FUT and Volta are decent but only because EA can dig deeper into consumers' pockets with these modes. Haven't had a chance to try out Pro Clubs or any online friendlies since my friends respect their time and money but nothing seems changed about these modes at face value.

The vast majority of problems are in career mode. The new coaching system on manager career soft locks when you go to fire a coach. Player career contract is hit or miss whether it'll actually allow you to renew or force you to settle for signing somewhere else. The required and optional objectives for contract negotiation are a welcome addition if they actually worked... Tackling rate contract objective doesn't seem to track correctly if your player doesn't take on any defensive duels to update the state beyond 0%. And the continued existence of the team possession match objective is pretty lame. Why should I be punished if the opponent AI is playing it safe with possession or my own team's AI doesn't properly mark or clear in a meaningful way to reestablish possession?

But if I want to nitpick the lack of UX consideration on EA's part a little more, I'd say the completely unchanged pool of press conference dialogues and news articles is still a big thumbs down even with a few new cutscenes for Player of the Season, Ballon d'Or, and winning leagues/cups. Is there a shortage of creative talent in Canada and Romania I don't know about that means this game has to keep all text-based interaction at a 2nd grade reading level?

And lastly, the new mechanics just don't feel impactful in a good way. PlayStyles feel like nothing more than traits under a different name. The manager career coaching helps keep players in-form but it would be nice to be able to fire a 2- or 3-star coach for a 5-star without the game freezing up. It would also be nice to experience contract negotiation as a player in a similar manner to the manager career counterpart... ""Signing"" a 1-year each season doesn't feel as authentic as being offered a long-term contract or putting a release clause in your own contract during negotiation. Plus what good does a contract system do when certain teams flatout refuse to sign you for not making enough sliding tackles as a CM or CAM?

I've been picking up FIFA almost every year since 2011 and I genuinely hope EA can address the issues with their undercooked rebrand from FIFA to EA FC. Unfortunately it's more likely that they'll find a way to butcher the series just like Sim City and the Sims. Alright, meandering review turned rant is over.

Just imagine that you play like playing gambling that has been arranged by the bookie, when you have a lot of wins there your team will be nerfed completely until passing the ball to the team falls apart even players who have a high rating become very slow.

What do you expect when a game dev gives like this? This attacks the mentality of every player and damages their brain.

This ea is a mess, even comments from people like me are never heard by him.

The dev has no shame and is only selfish.

Worst of its series. Worst football game I've played in YEARS. Never have I seen this amount of bugs in a previous series before. EVER. I took a small break because I had enough of the bugs, and today I started up the game again. 

Played FUT Champs.
3rd game in.
I'm leading in the 87th minute.
The guy pauses.
I score a goal... 
the game doesn't PAUSE.... 
Then in the 91st minute after a random pass, the game PAUSES and stays like that for 15 minutes. Counted.

I instantly quit the game and uninstalled it. 

The ONLY good thing they've done this year is that they've made Pro Clubs cross-play. That's it. Still not worth it for me with the amount of bugs. 

Not to mention the unplayable game itself. The meta this year is the absolute worst - the only way you can score is by running down the wing, into the box, do some mumbo jumbo and pass into the centre - goal most of the time. Everyone does it, and I don't blame them. It works. It's almost November and they haven't bothered to change it, so it looks like it will stay like that for the rest of this year.

It's impossible to actually try and play proper football, I find myself often switching between my full backs because there is no space in the middle. I've tried multiple formations and tactics, and I've seen a lot of really good youtubers talk about this as well. It's literally unplayable - there is no attacking intelligence from the AI. 

Also, defending this year sucks. It feels like EA is punishing you for making good tackles. 

I was looking forward to Career Mode too.... when my fun was ruined by a bug in the Coaches menu. You can't fire a coach - if you try to do it, a menu you can't close or interact with, will pop up, so you're forced to close the game - meaning you should only hire coaches if you're 100% certain you'll stick with them for the rest of the save. 

The game feels passionless. A corporate's product. Lifeless.

148389212,english,"FIFA 24 (FC 24) Game Review: Is It Worth the Upgrade From FIFA 23?

Introduction:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) is here, and if you're a die-hard football fan with over 20 hours in FIFA 24 (FC 24) and 400 hours in FIFA 23, you might be wondering whether it's worth the investment. In this review, we'll break down the good and bad aspects of the game to help you decide whether or not to buy it.

The Good:

Realistic Graphics and Animations:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) continues to impress with its lifelike player models, stadium details, and crowd animations. The game's visual quality remains top-notch, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) introduces improved ball physics, more precise player control, and better AI decision-making. These changes make for more realistic and enjoyable matches, especially in one-on-one situations.

New Game Modes:
The addition of exciting game modes like ""Street Football"" and ""Custom League"" offers diverse ways to enjoy the game beyond traditional matches, providing hours of entertainment.

Authentic Soundtrack:
FIFA games are known for their soundtracks, and FIFA 24 (FC 24) is no exception. The music enhances the overall gaming atmosphere and keeps you pumped throughout your gaming sessions.

Ultimate Team Enhancements:
If you're into FIFA's Ultimate Team mode, you'll appreciate the enhanced features, including new player chemistry dynamics and fresh challenges.

The Bad:

Microtransactions:
FIFA 24 (FC 24), like previous editions, heavily relies on microtransactions. While you can earn in-game currency by playing, the grind can be frustrating, and the temptation to spend real money remains a concern.

Minor Bugs and Glitches:
No game is perfect, and FIFA 24 (FC 24) has its share of bugs and glitches, which can be frustrating, especially in online matches. Some issues may impact the overall experience.

Limited Innovations:
While FIFA 24 (FC 24) makes incremental improvements, some players might feel that the changes are not groundbreaking compared to FIFA 23. It can make the upgrade seem less essential for some gamers.

AI and Referee Issues:
Occasionally, the AI and referee decisions can be questionable, leading to frustrating moments that feel out of your control.

Conclusion:

Should you buy FIFA 24 (FC 24) with over 20 hours in FIFA 24 (FC 24) and 400 hours in FIFA 23? It depends on your priorities. If you're a dedicated FIFA fan who enjoys the updated graphics, refined gameplay, and new game modes, FIFA 24 (FC 24) could be a worthwhile investment. However, if you're content with FIFA 23 and find the microtransactions and minor bugs off-putting, you might consider waiting for further improvements in future editions.

148363719,english,"Gameplay - 2/10 
Can't understand how a game that is suppose to be a football simulator have the most arcade gameplay i've ever tried, every game is a goal fest, it doesn't matter if you play against AI or against other players, the score will always be 7-4, 5-2, 10-1 etc... 
Another big problem about is just how unrealistic the players move, look like they are doing ice skatting in the field... and players with 190cm and 80kg move with the agility of a ninja... 

If you looking for PvP only attacking football with defense and midfield being useless this is your game... if you like a little career gameplay it's unplayable as the roleplay will be horrendous as every match is just unrealistic.

Graphics- 6/10
Graphics are good, maybe the strongest asset in the game, ambientacion looks awesome but the player models could be better.

Audio- 7/10
Nice soundtrack as always for a EA football game.

Difficult- 5/10
Game isn't difficult, just the defenses AI is just one of the worst ever... They don't react and attackers are too overpowered and unrealistic fast compared to defenders. Game needs to have a new control system to defend and make it actually fun and useful.

Grind- 1/10
Infinite grind if you are poor, easy if you are rich, 100% pay to win game.

Game Time- 8/10
If you into this game you can play it for many many hours do to his replayability and many game modes.

Price- 2/10

I have only really ever been interested in the career mode aspect of FIFA and tend to usually play football manager as it is more realistic. I knew this would have been a more arcade experience but golly gosh. Playing as Celtic in the English League Two (just to learn the game) I was sacked for not qualifying for the last 16 of the champions league (I wasn't in it) and also for failing an objective to sign 2 players of different nationality to the club? I signed 8 non Scottish players, 7 players that weren't English just in case that counted. Nope apparently every player is from Scotland in this game. 

The last FIFA I played regularly was probably FIFA 12 and yes, graphics and gameplay are much much better in this addition, however, I cannot help but feel that progress since has been underwhelming.

Passing is atrocious. MY Career player has already reached the 85 overall and it feels like im playing a 65 overall player. I can't pass full power cause it will just bounce off the player but if i pass it mid bar it fucking looks like i kicked those heavy weight balls you use for training. 
Interceptions make no fucking sense. how did fifa 23 go from simple interceptions and getting called a foul but in this game the AI looks like im playing MADDEN 24. its almost as if im playing against messi and he just payed off all the refs in this game so i lose in the end. 
volta is the only thing that managed to not make me destroy all my controllers at my disposable. honestly if anything that can fix this game is god because wtf is this....",2023-10-16 02:35:11,False,0,0,True,False,False,86,5,2029,0,629,2023-12-14 02:24:59

Update:
I still think this game is utter dogs**t. The AI just stand there when your opponent makes a through ball. They literally stand and watch. It takes 3-5 seconds for any defender to START SPRINTING. (Yes - analog sprint is off) You switch to your defenders and BOOM! you are now controlling a BOX TRUCK ON THE PITCH",2023-10-15 20:09:42,False,0,0,True,False,False,0,14,9534,119,4072,2024-02-01 01:07:35
148294419,english,"First ""Fifa"" game I have bought in 5 years because of stale and minimal yearly improvements.
Last ""Fifa"" game I will buy for at least 5 years because of awful player experience and awful UI.

The definition of bad game design is penalizing the player through absolutely no fault of their own, this game does it in spades. For example turning up the difficulty makes your own players play like they have never played a game of football in their life, even though they are 86-90 rated, literally to the point they cannot make simple passes or even your 6ft4"" defender with tons of defending playstyles not even being able to jump for a header against a 5""4 player with 50 strength.

Then there are the all to frequent ""super human"" moments where players act like they are literally superhuman, like taking the ball off you from 1 meter or further behind you, turning into Dhalsim stretching and contorting their legs to impossible angles to tackle you after they have already passed you, pinging the ball around like its a projectile and controlling it first time like they have super glue on their boots. The difficulty is also artificially increased by making successful tackles useless as the opposing player gets to keep the ball or insta-tackles you back, usually leaving you out of position and worse off than what you were.

There is also the issue of being dropped from squad battle games after the final whistle where you have won, saying the servers cannot process your request, you then get booted to the main menu and on re-entering ultimate team you are given a 3-0 loss, even though you never once lost connection to the internet or even the game, absolute joke.

The game is literally just an exercise in frustration through bad game design.

UI is just as bad, pray to god you never have to use the transfer market much, search for players with a max buy it now of 23k, says there is none, bump it up to 23.5k, shows hundreds at 23k.
Find a one cheaper and literally 99 times out of 100 it is already sold but wont tell you until you try to buy it, even refreshing the search will show the exact same card again, showing as unsold until you try and buy it again.

This is why FC24 is the unplayable, genuinely the worst Fifa i've ever played.

- Cannot pass without AI intercepting although your own AI will not intercept passes.
- Tackles are broken, when you win a tackle, you cannot control your player briefly and the AI picks up the loose ball.
- Player switching is broken, it assigns the worst positioned player when switching.
- Stoppage time broken, i cannot tell you how many goals i've conceded in the 96th minute despite there only being 2mins added time, the game AI WILL score  3 or 4 mins passed the allotted added time because it is scripted.
- Pace means nothing.
- GK rebounds are awful.
- In career mode you cannot switch out injured, suspended or player in international duty without creating a new tactic.
- Loaned in players getting upset because i won't give them a new contract.

This really is a poor game but EA won't care because they're still making money.

148221521,english,"worst fifa (yes its exactly the same despite the name change) ever released.

FC 24 uses the exact same assets as the past 5 fifa games. Commentary voices, animations, customisation items, AI intelligence and much more are literally the exact same assets from FIFA 23/22/21/20 and even fifa 19.

This is standard for fifa, although despite using the same assets this is by far the buggiest one yet.

Frequent game crashes, infinite loading screens and plenty of game breaking bugs including invisible players.

As for game play... It's EXACTLY the same as every other fifa game just with updated squads and kits. The only noticeable changes is the menus and music.

Also the HUD is awful. In-game camera angle cuts the bottom of the pitch off, which is fine, but also the minimap fades to the point its basically not viewable or in some instances (free kicks) it will vanish completely, meaning if you're playing clubs you literally cannot see your player or what is around them.

Difficulty settings are unrealistic. On world class, every team plays like prime barca. On legendary, MK dons play like Barca whilst your 1bn value Man City squad have the ability of 50 rated players. Clubs AI also feel really good some games and then are terrible in others. 

Only buy this game if you want to play online with friends using cross platform. If not, just buy an older fifa on sale and use mods to update the squads.

Feet and hands clipping through peoples bodies and the ball.

The ball teleporting into bizarre locations to match the animations of the players. 

The players feet and bodies twisting and manipulating themselves into disgusting contortions.

If you're searching for a soul-crushing, mind-numbing experience that will leave you questioning the meaning of life, look no further than EA FC 24. Prepare to be plunged into the darkest depths of despair:

Crippling Gameplay: The gameplay is like an eternal torment. Players move in erratic, glitchy ways. Controls are a baffling labyrinth, leading to nothing but frustration and anguish.

Surrealism Gone Mad: Realism is thrown out the window as players engage in absurd antics, performing feats that defy the laws of physics and common sense. It's a cruel distortion of the beautiful game.

Endless Empty Modes: The game offers a vast array of empty, hollow game modes that promise nothing but the gnawing emptiness of a life devoid of meaning.

Updates from the Abyss: EA's idea of updates is to plunge the game further into the abyss, making it even more agonizing with each ""improvement.""",2023-10-14 15:08:54,False,0,0,True,False,False,76,10,17611,426,3389,2024-01-31 17:56:34

148194570,english,"Obviously this is a new concoction and movement from the move when playing FIFA last season and switching to FC24 now, it's very similar to a new game, it doesn't feel like jumping one season but 2 seasons in the future. The newest third generation interaction from Hypermotion is directly referred to as Volumetric. The movement is indeed close to real players, its implementation in the Frosbite engine is really good to be applied to all real players with different physiques which have their own characteristics for each player's license, right, starting from the physical clothing worn and the physical anatomy of the body which is fairly accurate like this is a game with various dimensions of movement, what we actually feel is the same as when watching a live match on the field, each player character has different characteristics, body weight and height, which mutually influence their abilities, body position according to game tactics and timing. It makes more sense that sometimes we as players have difficulty guessing which direction to defend and which direction to exploit, it's very natural, very fluid, plus this playstyle is more assertive than the previous traits.

But that doesn't compare to the bugs offered to some other random players, on the device I play on the most annoying thing is the low-fps bug in cutscenes which tends to not be able to touch the minimum value of 60fps with the right aligned specs I have, you can imagine how much Nauseatingly, I saw 10-30 fps which was not constant but had massive ups and downs.

In terms of appearance, starting from menus, fonts and commentators, this is indeed EA's biggest leap this year, everything has been refreshed in such a way that the identity of the newest EA FC can be clearly formed that this is truly a game that cannot be separated from dependence on FIFA. But there is one thing that I hate to reduce playing this game for a long time, because you have to know that in EA FC24 there is no cutscene before the match for the cutscene of appointing the line-up, formation, and players when entering the field, lining up, and introduced. It's disgusting that there are no cutscenes like this, even though it's normal for football games, we play to feel the atmosphere firsthand and we pay according to the facilities available, but in fact it's not appropriate. It's really disappointing that EA FC doesn't want to share CUTSCENE LINE-UP or is this intentional to remove it, especially for NextGen users? Bad or rotten, for those of you who accept this major flaw, I can't consider it minor, to be honest.

And having entered TU3 since this review was written, my proud club, Chelsea FC, which has a licensed contract with EA, has not yet received an update on all its jersey kits with a new sponsor officially, even though it was introduced to the public long ago last week.

148189377,english,"This game is absolutely horrible. How they managed to make a game worse than fifa 23, I have no idea.

Firstly, lets start with the menus, the biggest change. It is obvious to see why they do not make big changes like this ever, it is riddled with glitches and bugs that they could not fix in 3, you heard that right, THREE title updates. Which means now and again you have to restart your game because the menu broke.

Next is the gameplay, are you used to the bouncy balloon ass ball gameplay of FIFA? It is here on sterioids, you cannot make clean tackles, the ball bounces around like a yoyo and the opponent always seems to have the ball after.

There is also the AI press that everyone is running, goodluck playing through the middle in this game, everyone results to running down the line and cutting across since they have no other options.

Oh and the keepers? Yeah they might show passion but dont except them to act like they have played a PRO game in their lives. An issue also not fixed in THREE patches. good shit EA

There is also the issue with the refs, do not make a tackle in the box or you are getting sent off for sure. They give red cards for the most stupid reasons and the opponent still gets a pen. 

Where did all the money saved from the FIFA license go? How can they cut a huge cost and the players see no benefit? This game is frankly insulting as a product. The SBCs released while good are incredibly expensive for FTP players, so guess what there is an 82+ x whatever in the store for you to buy, fuck the 70/100 USD you already paid. 

Pack weight is fucking awful, they added a double walkout animation to sate the gamblers who are addicted to packs while the gameplay is in the worst state it has ever been. 

Do NOT buy this game, maybe wait for a sale, wait for a patch next march that will finally make the game playable.",2023-10-14 11:21:23,False,0,0,True,False,False,58,4,15775,2916,4188,2024-02-01 15:18:14

148185866,english,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.

I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals. 

I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.

HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes. 

I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.

Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.

It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.

True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care. 

It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want. 

For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face.",2023-10-14 10:03:18,False,367,1,True,False,False,0,1,6651,0,2701,2023-12-27 16:16:31

Every shot on goal goes in, probably 1/5 of the shots on target gets saved. In my experience (playing with 89 rated Ter Stegen btw) my goalkeeper rarely gets a rating above 5.0 and if you don't know, that's a horrible rating. And that's not a rare occurence, that's every game. If you can't trust a 89 rated keeper to save a simple shot, then what's the point of the ratings?

148141500,english,"Having played the previous games for many years.

This feels like a step in the right direction. While I have had no issues on PC at present, the game still feels a bit behind the console versions in terms of gameplay and graphical fidelity.

Gameplay feels very similar to Fifa 23 with some obvious changes, such as slight animation changes and better response in controls. Goalkeepers still suck and Ultimate Team is a Rip off.
Season mode is going in the right direction, but I really don't understand how they can add so little in terms of improvements in the game year on year out.

They could easily add all the stadiums from the English leagues / French / Spain / Germany instead of having these random no name stadiums. Perhaps even if you choose the stadiums to have  in the league to make it
more immersive ? Story mode should never have been abandoned. Instead Player Career mode should have played similar to that game mode from Fifa's old. 

Co-op has been improved in ultimate team.
Same stupid system in Ultimate team. All the packs are still overpriced and takes way to long to save up credits to buy anything decent. Its a £70 game could at least give players some starting fifa coins and credits to help with the whales and over spenders in that mode, but I digress.

Overall its an improved FIFA 23. EAFC 24 should have just been called EA FC since its the first in the series. Fifa have confirmed they are making their own football game so hopefully that will be better than this.

There really is not any other choice in football games on the market. UFL is taking forever to come out and I am fed up of waiting for it. I might switch over to that when it comes out at some point in 2024 / 2025.

Its an average football game. The career mode is fun and Ultimate team is an abomination.
Buy it on sale.
This was a birthday present from my daughter otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.

Lets hope we get a better Football game in the future so I can finally player a career mode in something else. Ha.

*EDIT*

Update.

So after playing a while, the game frequently crashes or hangs in menus for no reason. Completely freezes up. The game does not even trigger ""Not responding"" instead it just keeps consuming memory and CPU.

The game would randomly stutter or freeze on the pitch as well during matches. I am having to manually shut the game down so I can re-load it back up to carry on playing. This happens every 20 - 30 mins. It is extremely frustrating. Which is now I wont recommend this game to anyone until they fix this mess of a game.

PC version is so under cooked and bad compared to the console counter parts.
I dunno why I expected better. Just another mess from EA with a little more paint than usual.
Bit of a joke to be honest. I can't wait until there is a game that rivals this game so I can play that instead.

EDIT!

This year its spamming the directional nutmeg and god forbid u lose the ball cause the AI will pass it pass your defense before you even have a chance to switch back because of terrible AI positioning. Goalkeeper is also unplayable still and AI goalkeepers suck too and are consistently out of position or deflecting the ball into their own net. I play as a CB in pro clubs and every damn tackle ends up with the ball back at the other teams feet for some reason. Defending just feels pointless because they always seem to just past it past the out of position AI and shoot on a goalkeeper who if makes a save just like tackles it always ends up going back to the other team. That's not a complaint that I suck I genuinely have scored so many goals because of that feature as well. If u buy which I know u will just know this game is still terrible and the EA execs should all be fired and banned from ever being allowed to run a game company again.

148083027,english,"I bought the game to try it out but like other players, the quality looks like an arcade game. Do you remember soccer pro the arcade game? I played that in the pub over 30yrs ago. It literally had two buttons (pass and shoot) and a joystick. FC24 is exactly the same visually, which is very sad, I have played FIFA22, (didn't bother with FIFA23 since there was no difference). But looking at FC24 it has gone backwards in visual content. How is that possible? This was supposed to be revolutionary, but it isn't. The career mode game play is good, that's about it. With PC I could figure out very easily the routine movements or passing options and cut them out, this is a bit more adaptive. But still, for this money, I expect magic. Sadly it isn't there. Makes me wonder if FIFA employed the actual game programmers previously responsible for the game to make them FIFA 26, since these graphics and stuttering and speeding up with lag -  it’s so so bad?
Apart from that, it still has that stupid glitch from 2022 where you can’t scroll sometimes and you have to use the mouse then it works.
All the pregame and postgame questions are exactly the same as Fifa22 – what you couldn’t be bothered to make it more realistic? There should be a thousand random questions, we have about 10… 
Also, asking how I beat the team again when it is the first game of the season? Or am I going to be out of the relegation zone when I am in the top 4 with 2 games left? Seriously? And it’s the same shit now. I played West Ham first time in FC24 and the question is what did I do different from the last game. Er, first game against them. Fix this shit please. It was annoying in FIFA22 but this is lazy. Even worse when it doesn’t know sometimes what team I am managing..
And, in manager career mode, when you lock to player, you can’t use the select button to see where your player is (like in player career mode), that makes no sense. AND the goalkeeper, he just randomly kicks the ball anywhere and you always lose the ball and get counter attacked. There should be a way to direct his kicks toward you. But, I have to run back to defence from my position and hope I am in time  for a ground pass before he launches it pointlessly forward. Often, he kicks it before I get there. That’s poor.
Overall, the CPU gameplay is much better, less predictable, but otherwise, I see a very lazy FIFA22 game. I didn’t play FIFA23, but seeing this, it’s literally FIFA22 but with worse graphics (FIFA15 was even better – how is that possible?). I don’t get it. Only the interface has changed (bright white and black, wtf?) and penalties/ free kicks/ corners are more detailed.
For me, the CPU gameplay is good, which is what I do mostly, but the rest is just the same and not worth the money.
For this money, considering what everyone was anticipating - it’s a joke to be honest. And I thought FIFA were a corrupt bunch of balloons…

148082373,english,"For a company which stated that it will be 'new' and 'innovative' game-play is a total lie, the gameplay is probably in its worst state in years. The game overall is clunky and mechanically all over the place, you have some of the fastest players in the game getting over-taken by people with much less pace, you got strong CB's getting man handled by small midfielders and wingers and keepers who are basically non-existent. The game is totally pay-to-win, it is embarrassing that you charge over 100$ for a game which has such a heavy pay-to-win method, literally there has been more store packs then content releases. Releasing 100K+ packs within the first few weeks just ruins the whole marketplace and shows clearly the difference between EA and the community, they do not care about the health of the population and the enjoyment of the players, the only thing they care about is providing store packs with the big what if when you see ""Guaranteed 85+ for two and 31 rare golds"", this cripples the market compared to 5-6 years ago and just makes the game not fun, playing against the same old constant meta-teams with the same tactics and same game-play, rely on auto-defending from AI / AI charge defending, AI press and then getting to the byline and then just cutting it back in for a tap in. For a competitive game, the best rewards should be won via winning games of champs, not loading up EAFC points and going to the store. It is sad because there aren't any alternatives out there similar to FIFA with the same quality and history, the day that company comes and does better, maybe then EA might actually listen to the community and put some good changes in for the community.

its really FIFA 23 re-released. The gameplay feels the same and their ""big new feature"" in coaches and tactical styles is a simplified version of tactics that you could already apply in previous games.

As primarily a career mode player, I'm blown away that this franchise still doesn't give you any freedom in customization. Why can't i edit players stats if i want? why cant i disable objectives and prevent being fired? why cant i track player statistics across multiple seasons? there are plenty of restrictions set in an offline mode that just make it harder and less enjoyable.

148040358,english,"I play solely on manager career mode so I upgraded to FC 24 mainly because I wanted to do one run as Inter Miami. I could have theoretically made it work by doing transfers on FIFA 23 until the roster was mainly the same but I decided to just go ahead and update the game so that the work would be done for me and so that I would get to try the new game. 

Game is about the same overall, but I think it got some nice updates: 
- Training is no longer required (or heavily featured) in career mode. I actually thought it was gone until I saw it as optional before game time. This was a big one for me because otherwise you were grinding for the ""all As"" with terrible players at the beginning of the season instead of playing actual matches. 
- The cut the scene were they walk out - I know some people gripe about it, but I like how the intro is now shorter. I was skipping the walk out almost every single time so it overall felt like it was flowing a bit better
- The new traits are actually helpful - The trait that lets you dribble is nice and the trait to get longer lines in free kicks is awesome. The latter is one that I will actively scout for because it so useful and make those free kicks less of a guessing game. 
- Looks are actually improved this time - When I upgraded for 22 to 23, the looks were objectively worse for me. In 24, the graphics are a bit nicer without requiring me to upgrade my video card. 

Overall, if you have FIFA 23 and you can afford it, go for the upgrade. If the price tag is too steep, you are better off staying on FIFA 23 until they have a massive discount on a few months. If you hated 23, then you will hate FC 24 as it is essentially the same game with a few more bells and whistles.",2023-10-11 20:53:29,True,150,0,True,False,False,0,2,10140,0,1607,2024-01-17 15:45:22

This being said, I am a huge fan of the series and the sport and the sweet claws of addiction coaxed me into paying for the full product even if I knew full well that I couldve stayed with 23 until a sale came through

148006799,english,"I have a huge love hate relationship with this game and series overall but it really comes down to the fact that there isn't a better alternative and honestly, there never will be. The gameplay for me at least has always been the most fluid and enjoyable out of any football game.

Career mode has its minor improvements as per usual, dead game modes like VOLTA and Clubs still exist, I only say dead because EA don't listen to the community when it comes to improving them.

Crossplay is enabled across the board with all game modes, unfortunately crossplay isn't available for the Ultimate Team market meaning we still have a pretty bad market in comparison to console.

Ultimate Team is really good, obviously pay to win but with enough grinding you can build a team of your dream players pretty easily depending on how much you play.

Honestly my one issue with this game is the fact that they made Ultimate Team have both men's and women's team, its not the fact that they are women or anything like that for me, I actually enjoy the women's sport, even if I have watched far less of it. It's more that for me, I have much more sentimental value when it comes to men's players and getting an ICON pop up only for it to be someone I have literally NEVER heard of, really sucks. In my opinion they should be put into two different game modes based on this alone but then you could argue that you are setting that mode up for failure given the fact the women's version of the sport is far more unpopular.

Put it this way, if I pack 93 Rated Ronaldinho I am waking up my entire household at 3AM, if I pack 93 Rated Mia Hamm, I'm shrugging it off because there is absolutely NO sentimental value for me.

Overall though, its an EA Sports game, you know what you are getting into, huge focus on the Ultimate Team game mode, pay to win aspects or endless grinding and a usually stable, enjoyable arcade experience.",2023-10-11 04:31:26,True,0,0,True,False,False,606,108,8488,44,8342,2024-01-23 13:55:50

Evolutions are awesome in my opinion really good feature.

Games fell not to fast and not to slow and with the addition of playtyles and playstyle+  makes games feel a little bit more interesting.

To the people who cant defend all i have to say is GET GUD, defending is ez in my opinion i have kno clue why people are moaning about the defending lol.

Last thing i should talk about women, cool feature absolutely love abusing them against people who cant defend and to the people that complain about their rating go cry in a corner you little bitch :)

147942020,english,"[b]Your trial has ended, do you want to revisit your review?[/b]

First of all I want to point out I only play career mode and none of the online features.
I really tried to like it. So much so I went to EA Play Pro once my trial was over so I can give it a chance. Spent around 10-15 hours in it and it is over for me. 

[b]So what is wrong with it?[/b] It's just bad. Very clunky, gameplay is super slow and weird. Defending is non-existent to the point that your defender is running away from the attacker, the AI is so scripted the ball literally goes through your defenders like they are ghosts and it is just visible the game decides ""oh you are losing this one"". Horrendous. I don't think I should use sliders to compensate for the incompetence of EA to actually make their AI either good or bad, but not just switching from slow and confused to rocket in a second. I play FIFA since 05 and this is by far the worst scripted one. And last but not least, it just feels like an arcade game, no cutscenes at the start of a match? Why? Who thought that career mode players would want that??? Anyways, this is the first time I am actually downloading the previous game so I can atleast play some football. I can honestly say at this state FC24 is by far the worst product EA could've come up with. 

[b]Posting my original review, so people can see I actually wanted to give it a chance:[/b]
[i]Don't mind the very small time I spent in the game, unlike many others my game runs fine and it boots without any issues. 
Also know I only play offline/career mode so I cannot speak of how the game performs online. 

Like FIFA23 I keep getting my SSD randomly spiking to 100%, making the game pretty much unplayable. It used to do it like twice a match, which was fine but now it does it like 10 times a match, sometimes it freezes multiple times in the span of one minute. I see EA ""support"" says we should check our disks for issues, but every other game I play goes fine and never does that. My PC is not high-end and besides those super annoying freezes it is quite enjoyable and different.[/i]",2023-10-09 21:51:03,False,1,0,False,False,False,56,11,558,0,47,2023-11-04 15:11:54

for me game is fun and probably gonna play on both pc in my room and on ps5 in living room.

147837503,english,"For the first few hours of EA Sports FC 24, everything feels familiar gameplay-wise, for better and for worse. HyperMotion V and the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller feedback return make matches realistic, with precise ball and player physics, noticeable field wear and tear, and goal post-shaking haptics. It's hard to deny that there's a lot of attention to detail going into recreating a realistic soccer atmosphere. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence part of the Hypermotion V technology that has been so heavily advertised doesn't live up to the hype. While Kinetic Shielding makes for some exciting battles, players still fall all over each other in unnatural ways. Advanced machine learning, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying constantly improving AI, is also hit-or-miss. Your goalkeepers will sometimes stand sideways and let an easy shot in or punch a ball that could have been caught, AI teammates make terrible attacking or defensive decisions that would have Harry Maguire blushing, and you'll likely find yourself yelling about an incorrect passing input more than once a match despite knowing you angled a perfect through ball with your sticks.

I thought FIFA 23 was bad for making me angry, this game has made me the angriest I have ever been in my entire life. I can handle losing if I know it is just a skill issue but this game just feels against my every move. passing on this game is also so bad I am always losing the ball because my player has passed in the complete opposite direction than the actual way I was aiming my sticks. the online is already way too sweaty but the only way to make coins is to play Rivals and Champs which are dreadful to play.

147800732,english,"Trash, toxic, will ruin your day, week, month and the year.
Manager mode has no changes apart from a few cutscenes, the core mechanics are still the 90% same from 2015. 
Online play is a big d1ck competition of who can exploit the most glitches. Leaving the toxic community alone and the trash glitchy gameplay, EA has decided to implement lag compensation in online play, which will punishes you no matter how good your internet connection is, making already abysmal defence near impossible, resulting every match being a goal fest 'cause no one can defend. Ultimate team is gambling sim with EA rigging the pack weight shamelessly. The gameplay against AI isnt any better, the difficulty gap between World class and Legendary is absolutely massive. You can 10-0 world class but then get 10-0 by Legendary, nothing in between. So either play every game know you can score at will, making it boring or play against an AI which essentially bends the rules to score (60 rated will defend dribble and shoot like they're 90). Even the games you will win would not fulling 'cause you can feel the AI being mild for that particular game (it will still be 70-30 possession, have fun). So offline play is a coin toss between boring or incredibly unfair and frustrating. Online play is structured around a unfair gambling model, populated with toxic community on the back of terrible gameplay. 
It is shame that this is biggest product on the market for the lovers of the beautiful game. Football fans deserve better. FIFA was a big part of my childhood growing up but, now it is time to let it go. It isn't worth it to put up with what all this game will make you go thought.

- Won 3 games in Draft, halfway into the final, lost connection to EA servers, up 4-1, forfeited 0-3
- Can't change custom camera angles and zoom, stuck in default settings
- No commentary - fixed now at least

Pros  - Gameplay smoother

Cons - Everything else
         - Alisha Lehmann not up to scale

I came back to it on free weekend 19-22/01/24. 
So the game is arguably worse. Pace is still a problem when u vs people. An 80 pace Reece James was faster than my 92 paced winger by a lot. In fact a CB called orban was faster than my winger. So shit. Now that TOTY is out its even worse. Im div 9 because i havent played any of this game, yet i came up against pay to win teams in this div. The players were shit. However they got carried by their BS TOTY cards. Haaland WAS STRAIGHT UNTACKLEABLE. No matter how many people i put behind the ball he just jammed his way through. AI defending is back in full force, yet wont work for you (Classic). Loans are also some of the stupidest things in the game. I was winning a game, (only 1-0 up but was controlling the game) then he subbed on LOAN TOTY Haaland my team couldnt do anything. I lost 6-1 because of it.

I genuinely am privileged to be this enlightened by EA for showing me how Derek's knee really felt. Really took being in someones boots to the next level except it was police issued boots not football boots. And I honestly think I am going insane over this game the analogies I have made on discord calls are the most whack ones yet and this was just an example of that. 

I would recommend if you play a style where you just defend and defend then twist and turn like crazy then this game is for you. If you want to play good, realistic football where you have to pass to find space and you actually can play through the midfield better luck next year... I wonder what tragedy they are gonna strive replicate then, maybe Pearl Harbor would be a good baseline.

Summary:
I am actually gobsmacked. How on earth is EA charging $1+ for this game is beyond me... This game shouldn't be out. The amount of menu bugs/glitches and ingame glitches is outstanding. You wouldn't experience this amount of bugs in an alpha stage game. Charging for this game is illegal and I'm the fucking idiot that purchased it for $100 (AUD).

The addition of Women players is massive, makes more variety which will only expand as each promotion drops. Evolution is interesting which also creates more diversity in teams as you can upgrade any player you like not just meta players (more to come).
New playstyles makes pace not as important but still important, new position change makes drafts and normal games more convenient. 
Playstyles makes players more unique unlike last year where players felt generic when they had the same stats.
Haven't had the first week of futchamps but its been decent. Pay 2 win will never go away but gettin a decent team is achievable at the start.
Gameplay is slightly different, crossing is more viable, 5back and 3 back is now banned in competitive play so there should be less rats. Cutback is still too common though. The finishing is also of more variety with new animations, finesse is more effective inside the box, and shooting playstyles will be sought for (chipping, trivela, power shot).

147661536,english,"Playing this game after paying $70 for it, I honestly feel robbed. When I first got on, I wasn't even able to play with my friends on Xbox due to an ""update"" causing the crossplay feature to break. Once that got fixed, we would get errors nearly every time we'd queue up for a match. We'd have to leave and rejoin the lobby every single time, and hope that it would happen to actually put us in a match. The menus are also atrocious - it seems like EA tried to design them in the most confusing way possible. It is extremely annoying how you have to enter a 10-15 second loading screen between each section of the menu. If you want to adjust simple settings, like video brightness or audio volume, you have to back out all the way to the main menu screen to do it. During halftime within games, you have to press THREE BUTTONS to skip the cutscene, with a delay between each button. I genuinely don't understand why it would be necessary to press so many buttons to perform ONE action. 

The gameplay feels really bad too. There were so many games were we needlessly lost the ball/got scored on because of server lag. The bots that are placed on your team are pretty much braindead, passing the ball to the enemy team at every opportunity. It is extremely frustrating to make impressive, difficult plays, only for it all to be ruined by a bot giving the ball away. Also, if you don't have the right stats, your character will pretty much lose every game. They will not win duels, make goals, or even pass the ball correctly if you don't have the perfect characteristics. What's the point of all the customization if only one setup will work well? I don't feel any sort of satisfaction from this game whatsoever.

147657029,english,"As an offline-only player that has continued purchasing basically every annual recycled edition of FIFA, I must also concede that this is probably the most substantial set of improvements to manager career mode that I've seen in years. It's not revolutionary, nor is it even as much of an improvement as it SHOULD be, but I'm also really enjoying it. Some notes for other manager career-focused players:
+ The tactical focus (e.g. counter-attack, slow build up, tiki-taka, etc.) and respective coaching staff balancing act is a modest but NET positive change. Not only does it just FEEL better to be able to have an organizing theme guiding a team's playing style, but it also makes it way easier to quickly assess an upcoming opponent's style and try to adjust strategy accordingly. And I like the *idea* of building out a coaching staff, and its current impacts are palpable and displayed clearly, but it definitely still feels more tacked on than truly well-integrated. I hope they expand on this thread a bit more in future iterations.
+ Tactical view for manager career, where you can simulate the game in real-time without directly controlling any of the players. I can't tell you how long and how desperately I've hoped for exactly this. I was glad when they implemented the top-down, circles-as-players sim option a couple iterations ago, but this tactical view is precisely what I've fantasized about!! I can finally get a vivid, fully-realized look at how the team and the tactics play out without my input, and it honestly feels more rewarding to see the team I built win this way than when I'm putting my literal finger on the scales by playing directly
+ Playstyles -- basically the ""traits"" system, evolved -- truly do feel like they meaningfully change a player's AI and capability beyond their raw player ratings, and better yet makes it easier for me to imagine players with distinct personalities and team roles.
+ Hypermotion: I can't believe it, but I genuinely think the animations feel tangibly improved from previous years. Acceleration, jockeying, dribbling, and other movements truly feel more natural and believable. Way moreso than in prior years when they've shoveled the same buzzword bull****
+ Though not really ""new"", I continue to explicitly appreciate the extensive customizability of the interface and difficulty (including user/CPU sliders as well as choosing the level of automated targeting in passing/shooting or player switching)
+ I generally avoid Ultimate Team, but I am very happy they included females in the same player pool. The whole game mode premise is pure fantasy, so why not!
~ The pre-game training session prep. Basically, you can optionally participate in the training sessions available in former games, but this time around it gives temporary playstyle benefits for an upcoming game. I like this in theory, but the lack of flexibility (for example, players are automatically assigned and you can't change which ones are given which benefits) undermine the usefulness. I still use this for big upcoming games, and it feels like a better inclusion of training sessions than in past games' fitness/sharpness balance.
- Basic and longstanding UI frustrations, such as not being able to see players' potential (e.g., ""Showing Great Potential"", etc.) for arbitrary reasons, like when they're on loan, their contract is expiring, or they're a free agent. Or inexplicably not allowing us to see the full scouting profile (including the text-hint for the hidden potential stat) of a player from the transfer shortlist. Like... come on.
- The fact that there is still basically no way to assess players' potential outside of the one-note textual hint mentioned above. Like, it's suddenly apparent if a player has 80 potential or above, but heavens forbid it's at 79 or they've just turn age 22, then suddenly a scout is rendered completely unable to render ANY opinion on how much they might improve. How is this still the only way?? Why can't there be a seemingly more reasonable and realistic ""High growth potential"" phrase or something, and/or a graph of a player's rating change over time??
- The pathetic attempts at player ""personality"", delivered via chat messages that only have like 4 total message options that usually amount to ""Please play me more!"" Either improve it or delete it at this point. It's asinine.
- The morale/fitness/sharpness system in general. It didn't feel like it added anything useful to the game, with unclear impacts on play. I pretty much set it and forget it at maximum energy recovery, and never felt the need to change it
- Some pretty game-breaking bugs, including an unavoidable where the menu interface permanently locks when you try to fire a coach (which you will almost definitely want to do as you get more spending money), requiring a full game exit and restart. I've literally stopped playing for the moment until this gets fixed, and the bug has been explicitly acknowledged by EA for several weeks but still hasn't been patched. Even for EA, that's low.

Overall: Still an abysmal year-over-year improvement from EA in basically all of their sports franchises, but I confess that this is the first EA soccer/football game in a while that has actually felt worth the purchase, for the most part.

It feels like an ALPHA version of the game: the servers are horrible, it takes longer to get into a drop-in match than it does to actually play the entire length of one, the virtual pro customisation is HORRIBLE, it used to be so much more intuitive and easy to make your player look like you, or whoever you want. Ultimate team is laughable, the whole micro-transaction-pay-to-win shizz needs addressing 10 years ago, let alone now - The menus are horrible and unresponsive. The new animations pre-game are just cringe-worthy, the music played before drop-in matches is too loud for the commentary, the commentary is an insta volume 0 for me - I have seen THOUSANDS of complaints online about glitches, issues connecting to games, lag, stuttering in-game, etc.

FC24 just feels like yet another desperate attempt to take your money while papering over the cracks with unnecessary and over the top features that do not improve the gameplay in the slightest. If you're gonna get this game because you play with friends, etc., wait until it's at least half the price. Hopefully over the coming months they actually update the game enough for it to be playable.

No matter how you defend him, Double tap R1, two player press, 5 ATB... nothing works.

147602757,english,"I don't normally write reviews for games but honestly i have to say, I LOVE THIS GAME. It been the first fifa since 14 i have grinded and loved the gameplay. Not only have i been playing both single player career mode, manager career mode but i have also been grinding UT. It has been a very enjoyable exp so fair. I Preordered the game and was playing it for 7 days before public release and as you can see im well over 100 hours so far. 

The game does has its flaws however 

1. The defending is some of the hardest it has ever been 
2. Running down the line and passing into the box is stupid OP and there seems to be no way to defend against it.
3. The mains are little laggy and there is a lot of button dely when in the mains themselves. 

HOWEVER there are some really good positives to this game as well 

1. The battle pass (or level system Objectives) give you a mega load of packs and really good rewards and i have to admit that it takes little to no effort to get up the lvs. You have Bi-weekly objectives where you can get 2000 xp for just playing 30 games in any game mode. You get daily xp as well which = up too 200xp a day. There is now 40 lvs for the battle pass and the rewards are really engaging as i have talked about above. 
2. SQUAD BATTLES is now 4 minutes half's meaning that the whole match is 8 minutes long meaning it doesnt take that long to play each match. 
3. THE EVOS are amazing, i know that one of them is 50k coins or 1000FC points but i promise getting 50k in this game is super easy as moment rewards are Tradable and so you can earn enough coins. 
4. The playstyles and Playstyles + make are amazing and really make the game more fun as you start to prio them for each player meaning that you can really make some amazing teams. Picking each player that fits your playstyle. 

I really am looking forward to what this game turns into over the course of the year but so far it has been extremely enjoyable. I really hope the Battle pass is just as enjoyable now when we get season 2 and the SBC's continue to being priced good and match the power curve of the game.

The developers needs to be put in a line up and shot for this fraudulent farce of a release to the public. I have been playing Fifa games since 1994 and have to say this is the worse yet, and will be retiring from playing any EA products in the future. 

I want a full refund for this dead game that needs to be burned, buried and gutted. Fuck EA for wasting my time and stealing my money.... Extortionate Joke Industry.

Any developer that puts out junk with there force advertisement of any product that dont work or run properly after releasing to the public should be fined and charged for extorting money from customers period.

EA are a bunch of frauds... We need to put a stop to EA Games for extorting consumers and leading us on to purchase their products.

I play mainly seasons and career mode and it is actually not a bad game, this year launch on PC is sort of better than 23 -- Too far from being a decent release state, but common... we are talking about EA games here...

147581719,english,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 
This is by far the worst football game I have ever played...

It is so poorly optimised for PC, there is constant lag, input delay, jitter, stutter, and more. It gets worst at cut scenes and set-pieces(during and after). 
The menus are severely delayed, you will press on one section and it wont work so you press on something else, only for the first thing to finally load.  

Lets talk about game play.. the meta is all about pace. No matter the occasion, if you run down the wing with someone with 90 pace, nothing can be done. Then run up the touchline, sweaty goal, simple... OR if you mark the sweat, just blast the ball and the keeper lets it in.. 

The game play might be complexity different if they patch the game and make it playable so you can counter the meta... but this is EA.. they don't care, as long as people are buying points.

Pay to win is alive and well, I got the game on early access and every match since has been against 90 rated squads with the likes of Haaland, Mbappe and all the other OP players. 
The struggle for people earning players and playing matches legit is higher than ever.

I would get a refund if I could but unfortunately I redeemed my pre-order bonus making me ineligible for a refund... Yes I am the biggest moron of everyone for pre-ordering an EA game.

EDIT:
After an addition 400+ hours, nothing has changed... 
Handicap and scripting is still plaguing the game. Some matches your players will show their worth but a lot of the time, your team of icons, heroes and high rated cards will perform like bronze players. Sometimes scripting and handicap works for you but most of the time its an uphill battle.

One of the worst things about this game and every Fifa before it, is the OP meta... Its different for each game and this year its pace running down the wing, cut backs, sweat goals and of course the broken finesse Playstyle+.  

I couldn't recommend this game less, the only reason why I put so many hours into it, is my addiction for football.",2023-10-03 20:50:05,False,3,0,True,False,False,0,1,44686,2659,5681,2024-01-31 00:37:14

I don't have any fps drops with my RTX3050 mobile and I'm playing over 120 fps. Before buying this game i had questions on my mind. One of this questions is having women in FUT. Having women players whom has more strength and pace than men sounded awkward and i still think so. But having women in FUT made more playable players in FIFA and at the beginning of the game it really helps constructing teams. The new skills that players have is really OP, For example I have CR7 in my team, and he has a skill which makes him to shoot power shoots faster and accurate. It makes CR7  playable even though he is in Saudi Arabia. If you are interested in buying this game and have questions about optimization or thinking whether game play is different, I can easily tell that optimization is good, and game play is improved.

But holy fuck. Skipped the last two years and still, there is almost nothing new or exciting. Sure some new cutscenes and changed graphics, but other than that? only minimal improvments, if you can call them that at all.

And the bugs! Oh my god the bugs... Clipping, wrong graphics, no graphics, misplaces grapgics, wrong-scaled interfaces. input-lag, worng input-read, no input-read, players disappering, kits not showing, misspelling. The list just keeps going on and on.

After I played it, gotta admit game goes smooth, in some way better then FIFA23. New features added to the game make it better.
But what I absolutely didn't like - cinematic scene been cut out from the game, like the one when players walk on the pitch. Why did EA do this? No players standing and listening to the UCL anthem? Ridiculous. Hope it can be added back in further updates.

Also in the Single player career - I don't get how come you can be sacked out of the team, by not doing one of the tasks you have in a ""contract"" or whatever it is. I played 1 season for Genoa, then moved to AC Milan, and after 1 season I got sacked out, as I didn't score ""4 beautiful goals"" ahahha. (I scored some super cool goals, like bicycle goal, far away goals, and it doesn't count..

I play against terrible gameplay with annoying delay before each gamepad operation.
I play against  inaccurate passes which don't match with my stick direction.
I play against broken interceptions when your defender already get the ball but it go to opponent by some magical consequences. 
I play against 71 deep + pressing tactic which actually broken and you cannot do anything except of ball losing.
I play against broken R1 dribbling which allow average players dribble like Ronaldinho in prime time.
I play against Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in match, when goalkeeper of your opponent can save every dead ball, but yours can't save anything.
I play against opponent AI bots in defending, which often defend better than opponent and do some unbelievable tackles without opponent actions. 
I play against slow players with pace 60 who can easy run faster than Al Owairan with max pace stats. 
I play against my stupid goalkeeper who cannot save ball which fly right in his body. Even if I move him by right stick and match with shooting direction, animation of my goalkeeper broken and don't match with reality.
I play against broken physics, when VVD can be pushed by player which is totally less than him in one and a half time.
I play against kick off glitches when you understand that opponent will score because of strange behaviour of my players. 

If you want to buy this game to play online you should understand that you won't be able to control major part of actions in matches.

Ugh, FC24 is here, and it's a letdown - big time. First off, the microtransactions are just too much. So, what could have been a tribute to soccer ends up feeling more like a costly slot machine where spending money is key to getting a competitive squad. Honestly, it probably shouldn’t even be legal.

And where’s the new stuff? The game works, sure. But it's the same-old, same-old, year after year. We’ve been yelling about this forever, but EA's just not listening.

We really need EA to take a break, skip a year, and give us something awesome and NEW next time. How about diving into a footballer’s life with a cool, open-world feature (think GTA vibes)? That would let us really get into our football fantasies and feel fresh and fun.

147451667,english,"To the developers of EAFC 24, PLEASE MAKE DEFENDING EASIER. You can accomplish this in two ways. First of all, reduce the computers attacking capability. They always do these broken kick the ball 10 yards ahead and then sprint to the ball, completely burning your defenders. It is also nearly impossible to win the ball back when the computer has possession. Tackling is really hard. In my past 10 games, I have conceded 1 goal in two of them, 2 goals in one of them, 3 goals in four of them, and 4 goals in three of them. On the other side, out of my past 10 games, I have won 9 and drawn 1 on world class difficulty. I hate having all of these high scoring games because it is so unrealistic and extremely frustrating defensively. Please fix your coding to reduce the computers attacking capabilities and increase the users defending capability, especially the user's computer. The defenders that you are not controlling on your team will literally let the computers attacker run through them. It is like they have a pact between each other. I have 2 more comments. 1, I have still not figured out how to move your goalkeeper on penalty kicks. I tried searching online and looking at the controls in the game, but no matter what buttons I smash, the goalkeeper does not move. He just stands still and does a standing dive like 2 feet to his left or right. Lastly, if the computer has a free kick within 5 yards of the penalty box, it is a 100% guaranteed goal. What is even more frustrating is I can see my goalkeeper holding a horrible position for the free kicks, but I can't do anything to change it. Also they haven't fixed near post goalkeeping. My goalkeeper will be glued to the near post and still somehow concede.",2023-10-01 19:33:10,True,1,0,True,False,False,0,1,14305,741,853,2024-01-31 01:28:54

147416474,english,"Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

→ Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
→ Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
→ Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
→ Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
→ Controllers not working properly.
→ Game keeps minimising on PC.
→ The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
→ Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
→ Objectives not counting.
→ Not getting XP when completing objectives.
→ The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
→ Stuck in half-time animation.
→ Game-play stutter.
→ Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
→ Anti-cheat error message.
→ Media questions still make 0 sense.
→ Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
→ Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
→ Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
→ If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, what iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",2023-10-01 10:05:05,False,0,0,True,False,False,171,66,1100,107,821,2024-01-28 00:16:58

I have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released. I have paid a premium to EA every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight.
The game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. Yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year, but along with those improvements which are minimal like always, the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time. I know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there, Please do not waste your money. I understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins. Wait for EA to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game, if they address the issues at all.

Issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay-
*The display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps. (On Laptop) (Desktop is Adjustable)
*The game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times. This happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other, when you are not even playing a match.
*Drastic and random FPS Drops every 5-10 seconds.
I have a RTX 3060 laptop with 64GB RAM and a RTX 4090 high-end desktop. Same lag and stuttering on both machines. So definitely the problem is with the Game software itself.
This is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry. The game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met. What a shame.  

Gameplay Issues:

* The goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant. 
* Shooting and finishing is the worst ever.
* Even though the ball control is better and there is an element of ""centre of gravity"" in the movement of the player in control which is nice, i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control. 
* Passing is the worst ever. 
* First touch is inconsistent.
There is so much more wrong with the gameplay. And i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update. I would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be.

Pros from my perspective: 
The menu feels much more responsive and faster.
The evolution of players in ultimate team is a great idea.
Removing position changes is great.
Game feels a bit more responsive but that could just be because it’s the first week.
Love the new cameras and how it shows during gameplay the shooting stats and different statistic.

Cons :
Goalkeepers are useless.
Goals from every angle.
Kick off momentum is still there and will always be there.
Ultimate team feels like some sort of Volta now, all those new female players with super ratings , the 1,5 meter female midget outpacing and pushing aside my Van Dijk seems unreal and unrealistic (even for a video game that claims to simulate football). I love this game and will continue playing but its just ridiculous, I don t mind having them introduced but make REALISTIC ratings which will never happen because no one will play them anymore so probably the FIFA community will just have to suck it up. I get that they want to push gender equality, but what’s going to be next? Make them literally 1 foot taller so that they could win headers easier?

147385115,english,"[i]Excellent game. Great controls. The ultimate team mode is very fun. Ultimate team does have pay to win elements, but you can also play it casually. If the pay to win bothers you, there is also seasons mode in which you can play a team against other players online, and the game will track your progress. There are several other game modes as well : manager, club mode, and volta. Volta is interesting and I admit that I have not tried it yet. It is a street football mode in which you control one player online, and it tracks your progress. I am really excited to jump in that when I have the time.


They have added women into the game in several game modes. I think this is wonderful! You can play the most popular game mode, ultimate team, and have both male and female players on the same team. I LOVE IT! Women can now feel included, and that is what we all want right? This is a wonderful thing! I hear EA is doing that with other sports as well and that motivates me to try out those games. It isn't fully integrated yet. You can not play women's teams in managers mode.

147373764,english,"When other people have problems launching and playing games, it almost never happens to me. I see all the negative reviews here, most of them are just the typical ""EA bad"" circlejerk, but some of them actually list real problems. I'll add on to that here with my experience with the game.


[1.] Game took 4 tries to launch in the first place. EA App keeps crashing.
[2.] When game actually does launch, it freezes on the first screen. Had to quit and relaunch again.
[3.] When I got past the first screen, I'm told to pick my club/league/etc. I can't move the thing to make any selections at all. I close and relaunch AGAIN.
[4.] Now my cursor moves! Oh wait, it's only moving in one direction and I can't go the other way at all. Close and relaunch...
[5.] Okay, cursor moves both directions, I can pick my league and whatnot. Now let's go make a player and start career mode! Oh the cursor broke again. Close and do research that shows this was a problem last year too. If you have a mouse and keyboard, which you probably do considering you're on a fucking PC, it defaults to trying to use them in menus instead of JUST the controller. I tried just unplugging my m+kb to get around this, didn't help me.
[6.] Eventually make my way into making my character, I get him just how I want and get to the main screen. I had to leave the house right after, so I save and quit. When I came back to finally play the game..... my save data was gone. My settings are not saved, I'd have to remake my player again, etc.
[7.] Uninstall and refund because if it deleted my character right at the start, I am NOT fucking around with losing actual progress down the line.


So there you go. I'm really bummed as I was really looking forward to playing this one, I skipped last year in anticipation of the new game having a new name and was hoping it would be smoother than ever. That is certainly not the case. I wouldn't even bother if you value your time, if it doesn't break immediately, it'll probably break when it will hurt a lot more later down the line.",2023-09-30 19:38:41,False,1,0,True,False,False,602,14,32,0,32,2023-09-30 19:20:49

Edit: 
at first it was ok, the evos and all but as time passes I can say that this is the worst football game ea has ever released.
The player motion is ridiculous, I can’t say how many goals I have conceded because my defenders run backwards, not running where I want them to, not tackling when I want them to.
The UT rivals and champions are beyond sweaty, and the skill based player behavior is the most obvious it’s ever been. One game my players position themselves great, the next one the game just decides I will concede every goal possible and the AI for defenders decides it’s gonna give all the room to the opposition players so they can easily score, and don’t even get me started on goalkeepers. They are non existent if you get into a match which you are supposed to lose.
The 72 automatic press allows Salah to be the best defender up front in the game and you can’t cross your half at times. Even if you get 4-5-6 successful tackles you will not get the ball, it will probably bounce back to the opposing team. If you see a team with Salah and Son with that stupid playstyle+ for finesse shot, you are going to lose, and bad since every shot is top bins and your keeper will do nothing about it. 
Conceptually good with the playstyles but currently unplayable.
It’s just at the state where I’m not happy playing and as soon as the game starts I know that I’m gonna lose to some stupidness.",2023-09-30 16:44:50,False,0,0,True,False,False,288,11,28684,2557,2586,2024-01-31 20:51:39

147352932,english,"I played FIFA 94 up to 2019. But before 2019 it was disappointment after 
disappointment. And stopt playing FIFA (any EA game for that matter)
So after 4-5 years how does the game hold up? My pro & cons.

PROS:
- It has been long overdue, but finally some costumization for own teams is back. Even though its limited, Its very welcome
- Limited stadium costumization
- the game looks okay
- I love football
- Menu's feel responsive
- I like the english commentary teams
- A few support chants are added in the game
- EA still have the licenses for the team and leagues

CONS:
- EA app needed
- 70€ not worht it
- Menu's are a mess. The game has many modes, settings, the menu system doesn't make the clutter any better.
- No commentary issue. I had to download english language pack on steam and then change my language ingame again to make commentary available. Also a brilliant move from EA to have audio for commentary off by default.
- Ultimate team: What a clutter of menu's. Let me play
- Ultimate team: Woman mixed with men? wtf.
- Not really expanded european football. It would benefit UEFA leagues in career
- Womans are in the game
- Volta is the game
- Ultimate Team is in the game
- GenZ braindeath music
- Career mode: Own team: can't choose players
- Career mode: Its basiscally the same career mode as 5 years ago, 10 years even. Only they added some training/coach training paths. It just a waste of time and it only clutter the menus even more with numbers and icons.
-pre-game intro is horrible: I like that tv broadcast experience. Now u see one player training or stepping out a bus. And a second later its kick-off. Were is the TV presentation. Presentation of the crowds, Atmosphere, player line ups are gone
- Everytime a player gets a card i get a POV of the referee. Why? I never saw this in real life.
- Gameplay: standard Time/scoreboard layout is really bad.
- Gameplay: When you score a goal or something the TV information is so fast i often can't read it
- Gameplay: is unbalanced attacking is to easy, defending to hard. 
- Gameplay: They destroyed defending when they introduced ""tactical defending"" many years ago. It was never so bad. players just refuse to defend or tackle and rather want to run away. If the bal is ""dead"" and no team has posession. My player will refuse to pick up the ball. 
- Gameplay: During a game they rather show all game faces of the goal scores intead of showing the names.
- Gameplay: Set pieces is just the same as last 10 years. The extra information were to hit the ball, and curved trajectory line can make it more easy now.
- The Generic stadiums are the same from 20 years ago. I don't see one new one.
- Career Match day: To change outfits you have to go trough multiple tabs for each game.

147336119,english,"For gameplay, the game does feel a little more different and slower paced than previous FIFA titles. For starters, you actually have to aim directly at a player for a pass to complete (except for through ball) and aim precisely at the goal to score. Any off positioning can cost you a loss of possession or missing the entire goal. There are new goalkeeper mechanics that I have noticed help more than hurt, especially 1 on 1s. Overall, my initial rating for the gameplay is an 8/10. 

As far as user experience, I just don't like the UI. It literally looks like a preset lower budget interface. Holding down your left trigger in ultimate team to scroll to what you want is just over-complicated compared to FIFA 23 where you had everything on one page. Also, I shouldn't lose a contract on my starting 11 when my opponent in UT quits the game on kickoff. I just could never understand why, especially if the game recognizes who it was that quit.

147326877,english," [h1] It's FIFA 23 with new lighting. Don't bother.[/h1]

I was initially excited for this, and I don't know why, really. FIFA 23 for the last couple months was buggy to the point of being unplayable, not to mention the game would randomly crash during every match. I was hoping that some of the bugs and text mistakes and gameplay issues that have been in the game since FIFA 20 would have been resolved, but no. ALL of the bugs from the last 4 FIFA games are back. At least it hasn't crashed on me mid-match (yet).

Unlike the last 4 games, this one doesn't run as well for some reason. I have a 13900k, 4080, 64 GB of RAM and have the game installed on a SSD. FIFA 23 ran at a smooth 120 FPS in game with all the settings cranked. EAFC 24 runs at a choppy 80-90. It's not unplayable, but the graphics are the same, the cutscenes are the same, the player models are the same aside from the presentation and some better shadows the game looks the same as last year, so I don't really understand why it doesn't run as well. The really confusing thing is that when I'm looking at GPU usage it's only at about 70% and CPU is at 2 or 3%, so my hardware isn't really being taxed and the game's performance is worse... for some reason. 

My time so far has been spent in Manager Career mode, so my experience with the game is limited to that, ATM. I will update after I've played the game a bit more. TL;DR will be at the bottom. As for the game itself:

[b]Cutscenes -[/b] Cutscenes are recycled from FIFA 23, which is unwelcome, as they were a massive annoyance to me from the previous game. I swear to god if I have to watch EVERY GOD DAMN NEW SIGNING doing that stupid treadmill run I'm going to lose my damn mind. And why do I have to watch as my 3rd string youth-level GK leaves the club lobby depressingly as he goes out on loan? I don't care, that's why he's leaving. I don't need a sad little cutscene to tell me he's leaving. Just have him leave. If it were a player that's been a regular starter with the club for a couple years, fine, but it isn't. The one cutscene I wish they'd kept is the walkout of the tunnel before a match where they go over the lineups for each team. That's gone. You still get to choose your walkout anthem for your club in the customization menu, which is strange seeing as how the instance where that's used doesn't seem to be in the game anymore, so what's the point? Yellow card/red card cutscenes are exactly the same animations but filmed from the point of view of the referee... which doesn't look good. I've had a couple instances where the ref's hair clips through the camera. It's also got a fisheye effect on it, like it's supposed to be a bodycam or something. Idk, it just doesn't look good.

[b]Customization -[/b] So as far as manager customization goes, they've added some boring-looking shorts, some more boring-looking shirts, hoodies, and 4 pairs of glasses. That's. About. It. I know there's more customization options in Volta for your player, including tattoos and more facial hair options (I will gladly take an comically-sized handlebar mustache) so why doesn't that transfer into the manager creator? Oh, yeah, Volta customization can be monetized and EA are money grubbers. Good news, though, EA, (and I can't believe I'm suggesting this) make the options for character customization in Volta available in Career mode and monetize them like you would in Volta or FUT. Players get better customization (albeit at a cost) and you potentially get more money. Everyone sort-of gets what they want, or at least it's consistent with the rest of the game. Kits are largely the same, some new selections, but not many. One kit option shows up twice for some reason. There are also KITS WITH SPONSORS WOOOOOOO!!! What sponsors are they? EAFC, Frostbite, Truemotion, and one other EAFC-centric one I can't be bothered to remember. There is one kit for each of them and that's it. Also, while I'm ranting: Why can't I have a color slider or color wheel for choosing my kit and badge colors? I get to choose from 10 colors for badges and 30ish(? I'm not counting them) colors for my kit. What's so hard about a color mixer option? The colors for badges don't mix with the colors for kits unless I choose basic colors, which just looks like every other club in the game. It's so lazy. I'm grateful that I can choose to customize a custom team, but there's better means of customization in other EA games. Dragon Age Inquisition is in Frostbite and uses a color mixer, so don't tell me it's not possible with the hundreds of people that work on this game every year. And how do they still not have icons for some of the hairstyles? A couple of them are literally just regen character heads with the hair on them, and one of them isn't even the correct hair. One of the icons just shows a bald head and when you select it it puts a hat on your manager. How the hell did this make it past QA? Is there even QA at this point? Probably not.

[b]Gameplay -[/b] The gameplay this year is probably the only improvement I've noted besides the lighting model (I'll get to that later). Players collide with each other in more realistic ways, They seem to have fixed players with explosive running trait actually running like a drunk slug, and the gameplay feels arcadey but not like pinball. Another addition is that when simming a match, instead of watching dots slide around on a JPEG of a pitch you can watch the game from the sideline like a manager would and make changes from the sideline.

[b]Bugs -[/b] As I mentioned before, bugs from the last 4 games and beyond are still here. Missing text, placeholder textures, flickering shadows in the background of some cutscenes, all this on top of the usual shenanigans you get during a match. In my first match alone I had a player fly 20 feet into the air after a tackle, watched another player run into and get stuck in the ad boards behind the goal, and the player who scored a hat trick went to get the match ball from the refs and the ball hovered in the air while the player walked away pretending to hold the ball. It's a mess. I don't understand how some of these bugs have been part of this game for several years and they never get fixed. It's downright ridiculous and shameful at this point. 

[b]TL;DR[/b]
I like the improvement to the match day gameplay and graphics, but everything else about this game is either a step back or the exact same as the last few FIFA's. Most of my time with FIFA games is spent in the menus between matches managing players and formations, scouting new players, so on and so forth and the updated UI just isn't good. It looks pretty, but it's less functional than previous entries. The bugs are just as bad as they've ever been and likely to get worse because EA is notoriously bad at fixing their games. They've removed things from the game that actively make it better and the things they leave in don't work properly. It's all a proper mess. And the fact they have the nerve to charge $70 for this garbage is just infuriating. Especially when I know the modes that have the predatory micro-transactions have better options to them.

I've already gone past the 2 hour return threshold so I can't get my money back at this point, otherwise I would be returning this game. The only thing left to do it to put hundreds of hours into this game and hope it gets better with time. That being said, there's not a lot of better options. eFootball is in the same boat, but with fewer licensed teams (also FucKonami) and Football Manager is little more than a spreadsheet simulator with more depth.

As for those already complaining about the DRM Denuvo and other security measures, I think it's for the best that those are in place to prevent hacks and other tooling that some bad actors may want to use to ruin the experience during the lifespan of the game. After it's one year cycle, as a publisher/developer I would removed and let the community, hackers, modders, etc do with it whatever they please since this is a yearly produced product that will lose it's importance each year anyways (No, this is not 1994 were you would get revisions for FIFA hopefully and have to re-purchased the cartridges if you even knew which revision it was, welcome to the year 2024 - stop complaining and asking for the old days, go spend over $80+ at Six Flags or move on sir).

For those on Linux (including Steam Deck), I'll fiddle around with it at the proton level and provide feedback to the github repository from my findings since it currently does not run on Linux. Hopefully it doesnt end up like FIFA 2023 were it stayed borked for it's whole cycle..

I'm not saying that bringing female cards to it is a bad thing but it totally fu*ks up the market and prices.
There's no more building your squad from the ground up (this was the case before also if you paid for fifa points).
I've played like 10 games and my team OVR is 86 as it was 91 in the end of FIFA 23. That shouldn't be possible in my opinion and it ruins the experience. 

The gameplay itself is clunky and feels non responsive. Graphics aren't any better than in the last years release. I wasn't expecting huge changes but gameplay wise i think this is a step backwards. Goalkeepers are useless, they basically dodge shots. :D 

It's not all bad though. I like the shortcuts they made for ultimate team so you can quickly go from sbc -> market etc.
Haven't tried yet but i believe that the manager mode is better than ever before but i mostly play (F)UT online.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND to buy this for full price. Before it was an advantage in FUT to start at launch but you get a good team instantly now so it doesnt hurt to wait for this to get a discount. 

BTW menu music is AWFUL i had to mute it.

If i could i would refund this and skip the whole game this year but because i opened one pack in early access they wouldnt let me to refund the game.

They changed graphics a bit, added new cutscenes, new movement (cosmetics for me), several good functions both on player (like agent for example or pre-match training) and manager career (improved tactics, no training system). As long as I played, I'm happy with the changes made. However I haven't encountered any game-breaking bug yet, but I saw some coding problems and that's all. I like the product, but it's too overpriced. Many things are the same, so why do we have to pay more for getting small updates? Especially there's no longer FIFA licence, so they don't have to pay 150 milions for it (according to the Internet).

The game still lacks Polish commentary, the first update made it getting random fps drops while playing, despite the fact I got enough resources to play it at least on recommended requirements.

147285533,english,"Completely and utterly broken. Do not buy

Blatant match fixing has always been a problem in FIFA games, however its amped up 10x in this game. If you merely press B or Circle to tackle in the box, you will give away a penalty and you will have your defender be sent off. If you don't do this, the opposition score. Every time you do score a goal, the opposition will immediately score and you will not be able to do anything about it. The ball and attacking players will literally phase through your defenders if the game decides it wants you to lose. 

As a Newcastle United fan, I obviously play as them a lot. Anthony Gordon, the fastest player in the Premier League is one of the slowest wingers I've ever used in a football game. Sven Botman STILL does not have his face in the game despite being one of the best players at a huge Premier League and Champions League club. Newcastle and Arsenal do not have their European number fonts in the game. 

Using a controller is completely broken in this game, just as it was in FIFA 23. Half the time it will work, but the other half you won't even be playing the game. Your players won't move, or will run off in some random direction, completely out of your control. In the menus, you will try to navigate and either nothing will happen or you will flick through all options really fast when you are trying to do something. You literally can't change players when trying to defend. You can't pass or shoot or anything, you will just run off the pitch. You have to then press a button 50 times for it to register what you are doing, by which time the game has moved on.

Please, please, please do not buy the game. All of this is aside from the fact its literally the exact same game as every other year. Don't be as stupid as me, do not buy.

I play offline mode so cannot comment on anything online, offline alone is enough to not recommend. EAFC promised much and delivers little, not unexpected from EA. Broadcast is now rubbish, pre-match broadcast and player walk out is now crushed together, you lose any atmosphere pre-match, walk out music is entirely redundant a totally unnecessary change which complete kills any immersion in the game, you get a few cut scenes and then straight into the match, watch football on TV and you see your team walk out, line up, shake hands, and in the case of the Champions League, stand with the iconic anthem blasting in the background, not an option in this game anymore. Whoever made that decision needs to give their head a wobble. Laggy as anything and my system is well above recommended and I get high FPS but still looks terrible, poorly optimised for PC. 240hz not supported. A few career mode changes, none that make the slightest bit of difference. Transfers are exactly the same as are the cut scenes, I had no interest in knowing what letter grade my transfer got last year, even less interested now. I'm yet to see what impact coaches have, my guess is none whatsoever, players will improve at the usual pre-determined rate. VAR has been in the Premier League for 4 years, longer in others, yet EA are incapable of adding it to 'The Worlds Game'. Personally i'm not a VAR fan, but it's in football so it should be in the game. Will it get better with patches? Perhaps but i'm not holding my breath. With eFootball not having a career mode EAFC is currently the only real option for offline gaming, if that's why you are looking to buy EAFC, don't! Certainly not for full price.

For those who are venting your frustration and saying it's our mistake we buy EA product, I wouldn't say it's a total loss since some of the modes in FIFA is still good and there is no other option right now, maybe in time once they have more competition they will make good games once again.",2023-09-29 15:15:47,False,0,3,True,False,False,0,5,2015,0,1190,2023-10-03 21:43:18

I know most of the people say it's the same thing every year and yeah, they are right. You are basically buying an update for the teams and their roster every year with a few extra in-game animations. Almost the same thing most of you probably do when buying Call of Duty every year. Now, the most important thing about this. Am i having fun with it? So far YES! Does it work and runs well,smooth on my set up? YES it works perfectly fine with some tweaks of course (no stuttering,screen tearing or frame rate drops) So in the end it's really up to you if you want to buy it and try it (Just make sure your set up can run it please). Besides, You don't have to buy every single Fifa title every year, same thing with Call of Duty. You can always take a break from them every 1 or 2 years and you will see you will have fun the next time you buy those games.

147273224,english,"I know what EA do all the year long: Making another trailer for us and change the game from bad to worse . I have never played in a game with so many bugs - NEVER . I have a strong PC but my game is lagging as hell, I was forced to play 1080x720 res , to play normally. Worse and Worse every year . Servers are lagging , it just knock me off during the game from ultimate team - I am loosing the game + my reputation . Also cheaters . I played 3 Drafts ... 2 of them was lost to cheaters , the match is starting they are doing a pass and I am out from your servers , I gain a loose and I lost the draft and the cheat is so good that I do not gain a played draft match in the objectives . DO SOMETHING  WITH YOUR SH!TTY GAME !!!!

Update: Controller is working very very bad , you can play 10 matches in a row np , but the next one it does not work in the game, it works in the menu, but not in the game and you can not do anything about it , you just have to quit the game and start a new one and guess what ? IT WORKS AGAIN !!! how, why , for what ? Optimize it for your players  , you are on a good way to loose a lot of your clients ! You are doing good EA , if that is your goal.

UPDATE: 
-It's 24.10 Mariah Carey started to sing ""What I want for Christmas""    and they still did not remove the kick of glitch on Fifa.
-The menu is still crushing when you are doing SBC/creating squads or buyng players .
- Ladies are stil OP . 
-The "" Y"" or ""trianlge""  pass does not work in this game, you can remove the button from your gamepad .
-Ground pass are still sh1t , 1/2 passes are going to the wrong direction that you wanted to go and thinking that pasing with R1 will help- you are naive.
-Swiching players ? forget , the game will switch to the player the game wants , not the closest to the ball or the defender who can cover the ball
-Broken animation , where you can clearly see how the scrips work when a defender want to get the ball from you and usually ladies are glitching because of the 1.65 m heigh but defending better than Van Dijk.
-Very often super long distance curved/trivella goals - very realistic !

Looks like I am crying a lot on this one. Yeah it's because they ruined the game I love and it is imposible to play now without laughing how bad it is. I am not a newbie , I am also not a cyber microwave , I did 9 wins on WL(not great , not terrible) , I am a regular fifa player , have been in this game since 2005 and I am suffering because EA gives a shit on people like me and pay more attention to cyber microwaves who are playing the game 24/7 and learning all the glitches and donating money in this game, cause PAAAAACKS  - are super exiting.

I recently had the chance to play the latest release of EA FC 24, and while there are certainly aspects to appreciate in the game, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the numerous glitches and bugs that plague the experience.

The Good:

1. Improved Gameplay: EA FC 24 does bring some improvements in terms of gameplay mechanics, including better ball control and more realistic player movements.

2. Graphics: The game boasts impressive visuals, capturing the essence of football with lifelike player models and stadiums.

3. New Skill Moves: EA Sports has added new skill moves to the game, which adds some variety to your gameplay strategies.

The Bad:

1. Bugs and Glitches: This is where EA FC 24 falters. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches, ranging from minor annoyances to game-breaking issues. ""No Commentary"" bugs, freezing, and crashes are common.

2. Unplayability: Some players have found the game virtually unplayable due to these issues, having to restart it multiple times just to enjoy a session.

In conclusion, EA FC 24 has the potential to be a great football game, but its current state is marred by technical issues that hinder the overall experience. EA Sports should prioritize fixing these bugs to make it the game it has the potential to be. Until then, I would suggest to hold off on purchasing or wait for updates to address these issues.",2023-09-29 10:32:31,False,9,1,True,False,False,0,1,9735,0,2874,2023-10-29 07:45:00

147263318,english,"FIFA 23 was a step in the right direction. FC 24 feels like 2 steps backwards from that. FUT PC transfer market is still separated from consoles, meaning there's barely anything to buy on PC. Mouse keeps being automatically locked in the middle while idle, resulting in controllers/joysticks not working in some menus. They removed players cutscenes walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game, etc. There's a lot of problems I could list, but it's not worth my time.
 BTW about the Women in FUT drama: women mixed with men sounds like it'll be a fun alternative for people tired of the same, however I see why it's considered by many as 'Forced Diversity': if it was difficult to pack your favorite players before, now imagine in FC24 where there'll be a lot of extra WSL players in FUT packs. Personally I don't care but it could be easily fixed if devs separated women & men packs, so you get 10x 83+ with only women or only men, depending of what you choose. But of course they won't do it because they want people failing to pack their favorite players, more packs being opened = more money spent by players = more money for them. 
Oh and they've said they will close FIFA 21 servers in November 2023, so maybe they will close FC 24 servers on November 2026 ? And every year, around September, they purposefully take out the specials cards from the 10x 85+ packs, basically only giving you shitty gold players at the end of the lifespan of FUT so you buy the next game instead.

147259068,english,"This is not only the worst fifa I've ever played, this is the worse game I've ever played
1. There are no casuals left
 Literally everybody is lying in a pool full of sweat giving their soul to beat you, everyone has youtube tactics, knows corners and kick off routines, EVERYTHING that is a glitch is used by the community religiously
2. There is no football in this game
This is not football, I can't even compare it to something, some people said it's ping pong, it's close, but not as good. The ball just jumps around and gets caught between players where it switches possession about 5 times in 10 seconds, which will drive you mad. The meta is run down the line and pass it into the center to score in the empty net. THIS HAPPENS EVERY FUCKING GAME MAN, EVERY GAME, people don't play originally at all, they just play the same idiotic tactic that works and good riddance 
3. This is not a game, this is a work place
You play games to have fun, the football in this game is not fun, it's madness inducing. The slots they have in the game are fun. So you basically go to work (play the ''football'' in the game) to get to the fun part, the slots machines
4. The middle of the pitch doesn't exist 
You just can't play down the middle, nothing goes through, the chance of you completing a through pass through the middle ARE ZERO. So that's basically why everyone plays down the wing and passes into the box... because it's almost the only way to score. Most people spin 7 times in the same place until you do a mistake and pass it, it's ridiculous 
5. THE PRESSING TACTICS ARE CRAZY
There is a glitch that goes like this, u go 71 depth or above, and the whole game ur team presses like mad. The issues is everyone has it activated, which gives you absolutely no time to relax, ur under constant stress during the whole game, very very very very very very bad experience 
6. If your team isn't meta, forget about it
You can't play this game seriously unless ur team is goated, players like mbape for example just ghost through your defense, and if u play the game long enough, you see all the keepers dive the opposite way when he is shooting
7.Call it DDA, call it scripting, idk, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
every time you hit the bar, the ball comes back to your player so you can score, if you go up 5-0, ur opponent team BECOMES INSANE, your team start acting like idiots while ur opponents team becomes godly. I was down 4-0 this year and managed to beat my opponent 7-6, I WAS WAY WORSE THAN HIM, THE GAME LITERALLY CARRIED ME, yesterday my opponent was 5-0, I activated constant pressure and came back and it ended 5-5, with me almost winning the game in the last minute. THIS IS NOT NORMAL
8. The game is infested with hackers
There are so many hackers I need a fucking book to explain how many shit goes on in this game
9. You won't see the good players unless you spend THOUSANDS
I've been playing UT since fifa 14, and trust me, you don't get good players, you just don't doesn't matter what u grind, how much u play, unless you take out that credit card u won't have the team u want

It's my first Fifa/FC game that I've bought to actually play and I really like it. 
Some things can be improved sure. 

But I don't have any problems with performance or bugs really. There's the one bug with the mouse where you can switch in the menu with the controller, but you just need to move your mouse again and then it works... sure, it can be annoying but it's not game breaking.

I like that there are a lot of rewards to play for and aim for - and for me who's new it's cool to learn all the new things etc. and try everything out. I get that veteran players probably have deeper understanding and can better say what's bad. 

Sometimes there can be weird things where you try to challenge/fight an opponent with the ball but it's feels like there's an invisible bubble around him and your player just dances around him - but that's maybe also because I'm still learning everything.

If the pay to win bothers you,  there is also seasons mode in which you can play a team against other players online, and the game will track your progress. There are several other game modes as well : manager, club mode, and volta.  Volta is interesting and I admit that I have not tried it yet.  It is a street football mode in which you control one player online, and it tracks your progress.  I am really excited to jump in that when I have the time.  

I am new to FIFA video games (now just titled FC because of licensing).  There is alot to learn!  I don't mean rules, I already know those, I enjoy sports.  There is a lot to learn in terms of button combinations, plays, positioning, and other game mechanics.  I still have much room to grow, but am getting better each play.  One downside the game has is the lack of tutorial.  The tutorial is in a different game mode and will walk you through gameplay mechanics but it does leave a lot to be desired.  Fortunately, if you are committed to getting better there are a ton of resources available online to improve your game.

They have added women into the game in several game modes.  I think this is wonderful!  You can play the most popular game mode, ultimate team, and have both male and female players on the same team.  I LOVE IT!  Women can now feel included, and that is what we all want right?   This is a wonderful thing!  I hear EA is doing that with other sports as well and that motivates me to try out those games.  It isn't fully integrated yet.  You can not play women's teams in managers mode.

after more than 200 hours timeplay here is my review for the gameplay
tbh purble place is a better game than fc24 this game is awful
do you want to win? 71 depth - 5 at back - cutbacks - direct passing - and There you go! you have anything that you need to win now its up to you
how this game works??? its more like rocket league the ball just gonna bounce 1284 times until you concede a goal like bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce finesse shot and yep thats a goal there is no point in defending the ball just gonna bounce back to your opponent
your cdms are man marked by strikers (Yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too !!!!!!!)
90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to score
for those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you something
there is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymore
its all about being a rat and have some luck 
do yourself a favor and stay away of this awful thing ( im not gonna call this thing a game anymore cause its not this thing is not fun or entertaining like it supposed to be)",2023-09-29 06:06:40,False,564,36,True,False,False,0,10,37762,2797,2239,2024-02-01 12:07:19

+ Graphics improvement
+ New gameplay
+ Great UI, But sometimes got UI glitch in FUT cant move / click
+ Dynamic commentator (you can turn off this)
+ Dynamic pre, half and post match cutscene
+ Camera view

- Cursor keep centered in screen after my wireless mouse idle, Cant move menu (Moments, Settings, etc. because of that)
- I dont like EAFC 24 song playlist, FIFA23 better?
- Poor graphics optimization, not ready to release the game?
- Should be cheaper, because no longer use FIFA title name?

ULTIMATE TEAM REVIEW
+ Faster than FIFA23 to choose player in squad
+ Claim all reward for one objective (Not all objective)
+ No longer wasting time playing squad battle, Its quicker than FIFA23
+ Removed loan player in SBC

- Menu with scroll down in the top left corner is bad and hard to see (container too small and need larger / bolder font)
- Hidden red dot button inside Objective page, Hard to see and find completed objective
- Sometimes objective not counted
- No shortcut to go to Squad (down left analog like FIFA23)
- Opponent quit after score the equal goal, not counted as win :(
- Swap side glitch (ex. lead 5-0, then your opponent pause the game and swap the side, you are now losing 0-5, after the endgame you got forever loop post match cutscene, force close this, no worry you still won the game)
- Sometimes force me to disconnect to the main menu and counted as lose (Hack? or Game bug?)
- Women in Ultimate Team is bad idea
- No kits color in scoreboard
- So many SBC requirement error in game / companion (ex: SBC need barca man or women, but marked as invalid if you put barca men in companion or barca women in-game)
- Cant skip stadium/tifo/etc. pack
- Removed rank progress bar in squad battle
- AI HACK IS BACK, FUUUUVK YOU EA!!!

COMPANION APPS REVIEW
- Unable to filter chemistry styles by type in transfer
- Unable to manager leagues consumable by league styles in transfer
- Unable to change club name
- Unable to change player shirt number
- Unable to pick some player in evolution, need to do it in game (ex: ferran torres in founders evolution, This item does not meet the eligibility requirements)

Well not really, but the game has improved a little bit compared to FIFA 23.
They made the gameplay a little bit slower to make it look more realistic I guess but defending got worse.
The defending is a little bit sluggish and slow in my opinion.
I do like the little improvements they have done in all game modes but it's not a lot.
Would I call this the perfect football game? No but it is fun if you are fan of the franchise.
I would recommend buying the game for around 30 euros or lower if you can wait and are not hyped.

147241270,english,"This game is completely rotten, do not buy it. 

The only reason I have it is to play Pro Clubs with my friends. I had  been a fan of Ultimate Team for years, but it has gotten so broken and exploity that if I was an EA game developer, I'd tell people I don't have a job, because I'd be that ashamed to be anywhere near this with a ten foot pole.

Everyone runs the same high press and uses the RB button to force the AI players on their team to rush you for tackles. It is regular to see an opponent's CDM in champs end the game with 11 intercepts and no tackles; those intercepts are courtesy of double tap RB, where a player can make their team cut off the nearest passes for the opponent - this has not been fixed in patches this year. The reality is that no one controls their own players to make tackles anymore, they just get the AI to do it with double tap RB, good old fashioned RB, or the AI doing offball tackles because of the 71 team depth setting. 

Lets not even touch the fact that they release different card promo's every week for the same players that everyone uses, and they have tons of 'special' packs in the store to get better luck packing certain types of cards (depending on current promo's), which is a blatant cash grab at your wallet. 

The scripting is no longer a myth - some of the mistakes your players will make if your leading past the 60th min mark are uncontrollable, and this built into the game by EA so that games are 'exciting' and 'competitive'. 

I cant remember the last time I actually enjoyed playing ultimate team and I gave it up in the new year. Now that EA have successfully moved away from Fifa and can keep all profits for themselves, they will only continue to get more and more blatant with this. Please do not go near Ultimate Team, especially if your a teenager.

147239728,english,"Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. 

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

 → Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
 → Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
 → Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
 → Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means). 
 → Controllers not working properly.
 → Game keeps minimising on PC. 
 → The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
 → Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes. 
 → Objectives not counting.
 → Not getting XP when completing objectives. 
 → The game freezes on the EA FC logo. 
 → Stuck in half-time animation.
 → Game-play stutter. 
 → Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware. 
 → Anti-cheat error message. 
 → Media questions still make 0 sense.
 → Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
 → Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
 → Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
 → If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run. 

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",2023-09-29 00:00:06,False,1850,0,True,False,False,235,88,8301,642,4594,2024-01-23 18:22:53
